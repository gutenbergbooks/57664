<h1 title="">THE ENGLISH LAKES</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small"><i>INTRODUCTION</i></span></h2>
<p>The present book, it must be understood, treats
the English Lakes rather apart from various
other elements comprised in what is known as the
Lake District. There is so much to say of the
waters and their immediate surroundings that no space
has remained to describe mountain, pass, and tarn in
the manner their beauties merit. Other limits to the
book are due to the writer&rsquo;s promiscuity of taste.
I am interested in most things&mdash;antiquities, fauna,
flora, sports, geology, entomology, and the like; but
in not one of these subjects have I that erudite
knowledge which might render my work of profit.
This book is written to interest those who love out-of-doors
without claiming any particular study there.
Of the paintings&mdash;I can only commend them to notice.
In my humblest manner I assert that only an artist
who feels the beauty of his environment thoroughly
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
could produce work so stamped with the innate
character of our Lakeland.</p>
<p>Of the history of the English Lakes little need be
said. We are in a backwater, so to speak, of events;
only the outer edges of great affairs have touched
us. The mountains have been the last home of the
invaded after their defeat in the field and their banishment
from the accessible level lands. Druidical, and
perhaps more ancient, remains are plentiful, along with
relics of Roman, Norseman, and Saxon; but these at
best only evidence sparse occupation. So far as history
shows, no really great campaign has been fought out in
our wilds&mdash;the battlefield of Dunmail (and only legend
fixes that) is almost the only extensive one within the
heart of the fell country. Great religious changes&mdash;the
Dissolution of Monasteries, the Reformation, the rise of
Nonconformity&mdash;have been far more striking in their
results than ever were the fortunes of war. The
mountains of Lakeland and Scotland stand blue on a
common horizon, and the alarms and reprisals of Border
feud were not unknown. But the hardy warriors from
nor&rsquo;ward did not often risk operations here, where
conditions were so unfavourable to their feverish but
unsustained method of warfare. The Civil War brought
strife between the squires, but no great action was
fought, yet in outlying districts the name of Cromwell
is not forgotten in weird tale. Though the land of
the Lakes has been free from war in the sense of
great happenings, it has been far from a peaceful
country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Our lakes are fifteen in number, ranging from
the lordly Windermere and Ullswater, ten and a half
and nine miles long respectively, to Loweswater and
Rydalmere, which hardly exceed the larger tarns in
area. Our mountain ranges contain the most elevated
ground in England&mdash;Scawfell Pike, Scawfell, Helvellyn,
and Skiddaw being over three thousand feet in height,
and several others approaching that level. About
thirty minor waters are scattered over the area known
as the Lake District; but I must not make a guidebook
of my volume.</p>
<p>My story of the Lakes will be told in the manner
it has discovered itself to me. I do not claim
originality of method, nor will my reader find much
savouring of literary symmetry and style within these
covers. My wanderings cover a long series of years,
and my recollections are as disconnected as they well
can be. I have kept no diary of things seen, and
scarcely regret the omission. There is no pile of
data to confuse me; trivial impressions have passed
away, leaving a harvest of perfect pictures to describe.
And if I fail in putting these to paper, my attempt
has at least been sincere.</p>
<p>Much has been written of the dalesmen. Some
writers deprecate everything we have, from our
mountains, the faces of which they hardly know and
the mysteries of which they have never dreamt of,
down to our social customs, which often they have
neither witnessed nor studied. To these nothing need
be said, but to our over-laudatory friends I must say
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
that &ldquo;to gild the lily&rdquo; is not kind. Dalesman though
I am, our faults are quite visible to me, and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
pinch us&rdquo; for them. I meet the dalesman on equal
terms. With him at &ldquo;dipping&rdquo; eve I have slept,
star-embowered, on the open fells. Many curious
yarns of the uplands are believed only by the wandering
tourist: inner lore of the mountain life is reserved
for the home-sanctum. Where, in my wandering
story, I feel myself competent to introduce the men
of the land, the pictures are as faithful as I can make
them. They have a store of stories, yet unprinted,
in the wilder glens: stories of weird things, of splendid
heroisms among the flocks and fells.</p>
<p>We have two classes of tourists: &ldquo;The Strenuous
Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Lotos Eaters,&rdquo; I divide them by
their tastes. Others call them &ldquo;Visitors,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tourists&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Trippers.&rdquo; The first they adore&mdash;they take a
&ldquo;cottage furnished&rdquo; perhaps, and anyway are profitable
in a staid, comfortable manner; the second they
tolerate&mdash;he is a man of hotels and boarding houses,
here to-day, and to-morrow &ldquo;away ower t&rsquo;fell,&rdquo; but,
by reason of his plenty, worthy attention; the third
they despise; many seem to think that the day-visitor
ought to be put down&mdash;by violence preferably.</p>
<p>To revert to my own division of our visitors, I feel
that my tastes join me in both types. I like the
peaceful vales and lakes where the &ldquo;lotos-eaters&rdquo; idle
the summer hours away, and perhaps the detailed
descriptions of so many days of ease may incline the
reader to believe that I care nothing for the fells.
But I love the breezy uplands, the miles of free moor,
the peaks and the crags.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>A few words about accommodation and routes of
travel are unavoidable. There are huge hotels with
fashionable prices, smaller ones that are as comfortable
or more so, at a fifth of the cost, and boarding houses
in large numbers. But sometimes in August there
are more tourists than can be comfortably put up even in
our village-towns. However, the Lake District is small,
and, if Ambleside be thought full, there is Grasmere
not far away and Bowness within five miles. All three
places are unlikely to suffer from excess of visitors
at the same time. Of the remoter dales let me
tell you a story. Two young men wandered into
a certain dale-head where there are but two homes
for tourists. At the first they asked for a couple of
rooms. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t <i>one</i> to spare.&rdquo; The way had
dealt hardly with them, and at the second they
moderated their request to &ldquo;two rooms, but if quite
necessary we don&rsquo;t mind sharing one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless thee, my lad,&rdquo; said outspoken old
Mother, &ldquo;ther&rsquo;s three to ivvery bed, an&rsquo; two to ivvery
table awreddy. But mappen I can put you up in
t&rsquo; barn with them others.&rdquo; The barn across the yard
had been pressed into service as a bedroom; but at
the prospect these townsmen shivered, thanked the
good lady, and walked wearily towards the dale-foot
three miles off (where the excess of tourists was still
great, though not so marked). The moral is, if you
intend to make any place a centre for your journeys
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
engage a room there, but&mdash;I was just preparing for
repose when a knock came to my door. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; I
answered. &ldquo;Please, sir, there&rsquo;s another lady just come
in, and will you give up your bedroom for her?&rdquo; I
slept in less comfortable quarters that night, with half
a score others who, by chivalry or improvidence, were
without rooms.</p>
<p>Three railway systems touch the Lake District.
The London and North-Western runs up one side
with its main line, and casts a branch from Oxenholme
to Windermere, which is a very popular way to reach
the Lakes. From its terminus regular lines of coaches
run to Coniston, Ullswater, and Keswick, as well as to
Bowness, Ambleside, and Grasmere. A new company
is putting on more motor-cars to cope with the
traffic between the terminus and Ambleside and
Grasmere. The main London and North-Western
line at Shap is near Haweswater, an area growing
in renown among tourists. At Penrith it is near
Ullswater, and regular coaches connect with the
steamers there. A company has exploited motor-traffic
from Penrith to Patterdale, partly for passengers,
partly to carry the output of the Glenridding lead
mines.</p>
<p>The Furness Railway is <i>the</i> railway of the Lake
District. From Carnforth, where it connects with
the London and North-Western main line and with
the northern arm of the Midland Railway, it sweeps
round Morecambe bay to Ulverston. Here it throws
branch the first to connect the steam-yachts on
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Windermere with the outer world. By means of
these tourists are poured into Bowness and Ambleside
in great numbers. A line of coaches connect Ulverston
with the foot of Coniston Lake. The main Furness line
passes through warrior Barrow to the Duddon, where
branch the second goes off winding through the hills
to Coniston. From Coniston there is coach connection
with all parts of the Lake Country. The main line
has not yet, however, finished with the Lakes. It
crosses the Duddon and swerves round the foot of
Black Combe to Millom of the hematite beds, then
away through a beautiful district between the fells
and the sea to Ravenglass and to Seascale, where
a good road leads up to Wastwater. At Sellafield
another branch is thrown through Egremont, within
a few miles of Ennerdale Lake. The London and
North-Western comes on to the scene again here,
a branch bearing southward from Carlisle and tapping
a district rich in iron ore, but fringed with lovely
valleys.</p>
<p>The Lake Country is also served by the Cockermouth,
Keswick, and Penrith line, as important for
the north as the Furness line is to the south. It
connects the London and North-Western at Penrith
with the Furness at Whitehaven, passing by Derwentwater
and Bassenthwaite. At Threlkeld it is nearest
Thirlmere, at Troutbeck it is nearest Ullswater, while
from Cockermouth the tourist may easily reach Loweswater,
Crummock, and Buttermere.</p>
<p>The North-Eastern and Midland Railways both
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
come into Penrith, which is an important junction
for the Lakes, and an interesting town in itself.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to give any space to a
description of the internal traffic of the country&mdash;it
is plentiful and good.</p>

<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small"><i>BY STEAM YACHT ON WINDERMERE</i></span></h2>
<p>From its foot at Newby Bridge to the circling
beach at Waterhead, Windermere, the largest
of our Lakes, is full of interest. Not a bay on either
bank fails in variety of scene, while from mid-lake
the surroundings are ever changing. The ideal way
to see Windermere is from a small boat; the journey,
coasting every bay and yet not losing the broader
views of mid-water, should not take less than two
long summer days. Of course few can spare so much
time to the pleasant task. By steamer in a short
afternoon and at a moderate expense it is possible to
make the tour of the lake. The visitor, however, can
taste some of the pleasures of the ideal if he spare
an evening for boating. From Bowness steer past
the corner of Belle Isle; then as you near the Furness
shore, turn right or left as fancy directs, coasting under
larch-hung bluffs toward the Ferry, with Belle Isle
on the left, or passing alder-fringed meadows past
Rawlinson&rsquo;s Nab for Wray. The Furness shore is
rather the more diverse, and your rowing there at
the close of day does not disturb the many anglers
who frequent Millerground. From Lakeside the boat
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
can be turned in any direction. Many wish to see
the Leven leaving the lake: it is but a half-mile away.
Paddling quietly beneath Gummers Howe is delightful;
but the person with a taste for detail in light and
shadow may decide that the opposite shore, with its
view of the fell across the clear water, has even more
charm.</p>
<p>By steamer the great majority see Windermere.
The boats are large, and, though at some hours
crowded, fairly often carry quite a few passengers.
At mid-afternoon I have sailed from Bowness to
Ambleside, a solitary passenger,&mdash;and that during the
height of the touring season. From the deck of the
steamer as it lies berthed at Lakeside there is a
glorious view. The steep side of Gummers Howe,
green in summer with bracken, golden with the young
tendrils in spring, and in autumn russet with fading
glory, rises opposite. Like a wide river the lake
winds further and still further as your eyes turn toward
the mountains. Yes, there they are, blue with distance&mdash;sharp
peaks limning strongly against the sunlit sky.
At present the lake is still as a mirror; drippings from
the oars of passing boats make little glittering ripples.
But though the views are so beauteous, it is well for
a contemplative person to sit near the gangway and
watch the throng which the latest train has brought
from the outside world. There are two tall ladies,
evidently school ma&rsquo;ams, with much luggage and the
power of looking after it without fuss; the stout old
gentleman there has come this many years for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
sojourn by the shore of Windermere. I don&rsquo;t know
his name, but his portly person is frequently seen
on board the steamers. &rsquo;Cute chap that, say the
lakemen; he has a season ticket and takes out full
value. Now there is a quiet whirring of the screw;
the captain, a white-bearded man with many years&rsquo;
service on the lake, sounds the whistle for the last
time, and the echo dies away among the hazels and
coppices around. The water, with a quiet churning
sound, parts in front of the boat and we are well
away. Don&rsquo;t look back, unless it be to catch a glimpse
of where lake finally narrows into river.</p>
<p>The boat speeds past one or two wooded islets:
in spring the undergrowth is blue with wild hyacinths.
The afternoon sunlight glints upward from the calm
water as from a mirror. By Finsthwaite the woods
are rich green. Of cultivated land we see but little:
here a cornfield between woods and lake; there, evenly
hoed patches of turnips and potatoes, or more often
meadows where rich grass is mantled in the white and
yellow of ox-eyes and buttercups. Peeping between
green bowers of sycamore and ash are one or two farmsteadings.
Old and weathered, built of blue-grey stone,
they harmonise well with their surroundings. Do
our eyes, accustomed to these from birth, feel in
this hoariness of theirs a rare beauty which is purely
imaginary? We almost hate the sight of a modern-built
villa, trim without, healthy and comfortable
within. I make no pretension to the artistic temperament:
subordinate the villa to its surroundings, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
I am content; but stick a horror of brick and red
tiles in all its nakedness on a commanding hillside,
or right on the edge of a beautiful mere, and the
wanderer is above human whose temper is not tried
at the sight. Pretty bungalows, for occasional occupation,
are springing up on the shores of Windermere;
they are welcome, be the woodlands around them sere
or green.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="716" />
<p class="caption">SWAN INN, NEWBY BRIDGE, WINDERMERE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>When not watching the glorious picture unfolding
as the steamer passes bay and creek, headland and
rocky cove, there is to me much interest in observing
other people on the boat. For the deck of a
Windermere lake yacht has often as cosmopolitan a
load as a cheap emigrant or &ldquo;special tour&rdquo; steamer.
True, there is little distinction of nationality in dress;
but the voices are often without disguise. Frenchmen,
Swiss, and Germans are not unusual, while Americans
are frequent. Here let me defend our friends from
across the Atlantic. They are seldom the loud,
almost vulgar critics of our lake scenery they are
popularly supposed to be. Most of our visitors are
readers of Wordsworth, of Ruskin, and our other
poets in prose and verse, and know what to expect.
A Yale man I once accompanied from Windermere
to Keswick stated: &ldquo;It is the breathlessness of Lakeland
which surprises me. Here there is a memory
of De Quincey or Coleridge: next moment there
is a story of Christopher North. I lift mine eyes
suddenly from the pastoral scenes of Wordsworth
to the blue skies and mountains of Ruskin. Your
country-side is breathless with lore: America has
no place to compare it with.&rdquo; I am not a &ldquo;hail-fellow&rdquo;
person, preferring to be seen, not heard, and
as the boat glides along I silently piece together,
from external evidence, the little stories of my co-passengers.
To-day there is a young man pacing
the boat amidships. He is no chance visitor, I judge,
by the anxious way he keeps looking ahead. There
is some point he evidently does not wish to miss.
Presently I hear a movement of his arm: he has
drawn out his handkerchief and is waving it. Every
eye turns to find out where he is signalling. In
a moment we catch an answering flutter: there is
a lady in white blouse and dark skirt on the shingles
beneath the wood. Something in the message heartens
our fellow-passenger; a load of anxiety has left him.
Again and again he signals&mdash;ever there is an answer.
Then a lithe dark figure springs into a path from
the shore, and runs out of sight among the bushes.
A child is hastening to give some one the news that
the desired steamer is passing. Now, from the front
of a bungalow, hardly to be seen for larches, another
signal begins to jerk. Our passenger answers this
also till the yacht sweeps out of the bay.</p>
<p>The promontory of Storrs now pushes out, and
here the steamer will stop. The call of the syren,
like an enormous flute, rings full and sonorous over
the water, and dies in tuneful cadences, each softer
and more sweet, through the green ghylls and
swelling hills. The road to the pier runs close to
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
the lake: a cyclist is rushing along vieing our boat
in speed. The signaller has seen him, and smiles.
In a minute we are past the narrow stone embankment
with its small summer-house, and are
purring alongside the newer wooden pier. The
cyclist speeds into sight through an avenue of trees,
and dismounts close by. The gangway is thrown
aboard&mdash;the signaller is the first ashore. The cyclist
exchanges a word, and they walk from view together.
A story of joy and peace and love is maybe working
itself out before us, and the whole while, seated on
the opposite seat, a lady has been gloating over the
theatricalities of miserable &ldquo;life&rdquo; as depicted by
Marie Corelli. Better advised is the one who patrols
the deck with a volume of the best carefully tucked
under his arm. That book will be digested presently
when lamps are lit and night like a velvet pall descends
over lake and mountain.</p>
<p>Storrs Hall&mdash;now an hotel&mdash;was occupied a century
ago by Mr. Bolton, who, a man of literary tastes,
thought noble friendships a boon. He communed
with Wordsworth, North, Sir Walter Scott, De
Quincey, and many others who were attracted to
that great coterie of genius. In these days the
poetry of the Lakes school is often sneered at. The
men with their simple tastes and pleasures are
despised, but, leaving their work aside, never in
history has a group of men so able, so high-minded,
so far in advance of their day and generation, been
so intimately associated. They had their weaknesses,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
their vices, but conducted their worst hours without
impairing the morality of their surroundings.
Their influence was wholly for good, wholly for an
upward trend of thought.</p>
<p>As the <i>Swift</i> threads through the reefs above Storrs,
we enter a new reach of the lake. In front Belle
Isle&rsquo;s tree-shaded level seems to close the water; to
our left is the Ferry; on the right green fields and
filmy woods, with, beyond and above, the mountains
clustering round the vale of Troutbeck. A faint
blue ruffle travels along the lake toward us, a catspaw
of wind that sends a yacht which, sail-slack, had
been drifting, bowing and dancing through the water.
At the landing-stage our steamer has to wait till
the tank-like cable-boat has completed its journey.
Down the hill opposite comes the road from Kendal
to Hawkshead, and about this point, from time
immemorial, the lake has been crossed. Various
sorts of craft have been used: in the time of the
Lake poets the conveyance was a large and almost flat-bottomed
boat, pulled along by sweeps. Christopher
North was wont, on a Saturday morning, to come
down from Elleray to steer the market-folk across.
On one of these occasions he noticed a flurry in
the water, as of a struggling fish. The boat&rsquo;s course
was diverted, and a landing-net used. Two pike,
each of about six pounds weight, had been fighting.
The victor had seized his antagonist by the head
and endeavoured to swallow him whole. But, as an
American has sagely commented, &ldquo;he had bit off more
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
than he could chew.&rdquo; When North&rsquo;s landing-net
lifted the pair, his jaws were still locked round the
victim&rsquo;s shoulders, though the biter had drowned.
Though badly mauled, the other fish was still feebly
alive. In his fishing reminiscences of the Borders
Sir Walter Scott told a similar story. Near the
Tweed one day, seeing a commotion on its banks,
he asked a laddie what the matter was. &ldquo;I dinna
ken exactly,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a muckle
fush wi&rsquo; twa tails i&rsquo; t&rsquo; watter.&rdquo; Anglers&mdash;and more
veracious folk&mdash;have similar stories to tell. The
version I have given above of Christopher North&rsquo;s
experience is not, I am aware, the accepted one:
it was given me, several years ago, by a dales dweller,
one of whose parents had witnessed the incident.
There are legends to tell of this Ferry. The most
sinister is of an awful voice which on wild nights
began to peal across the turmoil&mdash;&ldquo;Boat!&rdquo; Once
a bold ferryman answered the call, put off his boat
and rowed into the storm and darkness. Half an
hour later he returned, with boat swamping and
without a passenger. The boatman&rsquo;s face was ashen
with terror; he was dumb. Next day he died.
Stories there were of demons carrying off their spoils
of witched souls, and even the bodies of dead saints,
across the lake. No boatman, after this incident,
could be prevailed to put off in darkness, so a
priest was summoned from the Holy Holme. With
bell and book he raised the skulking demon&mdash;at
midday there was the voice of storm in the air, though,
mindful of the call of the Master on Galilee, the
water fell calm. Voices argued with the priest, whose
cross planted firmly by the edge of the lake was
surrounded by terror-struck lakemen. At the end
of a long altercation the demon released from thrall
the soul of the boatman, and craved for mercy. For
its peace, the priest laid the evil thing in the depths
of Claife, there to remain until &ldquo;dryshod men walk
on Winander, and trot their ponies through the solid
crags.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>At least once the ferryboat has been wrecked: the
records of Hawkshead Church show that a wedding
party was drowned, about a dozen lives in all being
lost. The tank-like servant of the cable now against
the shingles has shown sea-like jauntiness. One
Whit Saturday morning, when laden with strength and
beauty going to Kendal hirings, she broke both
hawsers and at a majestic pace drifted down the lake.
In half an hour she touched one of the islands,
from which her passengers were shortly taken off.
In these times of watertight compartments, there is
little chance of a disaster occurring.</p>
<p>The hotel in front of which our <i>Swift</i> is floating
presents a gay appearance on yacht-racing days. The
lawns are occupied by a well-dressed throng, and a
small but excellent band plays appropriate music. The
line of red-flagged buoys marks start and finish:
some of the races are round the lake, about twenty
miles; others are fought out in the northern or southern
basins only. The needs of the racing have developed
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
a special type of boat. The quest for speed dictates
no great displacement of water, therefore the craft
are built shallow; but the frequent and violent squalls
of wind from the mountains make some stability
and weight essential to prevent capsize. Windermere
yachts carry heavier keels than is usual to their
sail area, and there are other minor variations between
them and sea-going or conventional river and lake
boats. With a good breeze the yachts are very
fast: they are handy too, frequently &ldquo;going about&rdquo;
in narrow quarters. At times, when the air is dead
calm, a race may degenerate into a drifting match:
the lakemen say that on one occasion the yachts
were over ten hours in covering as many miles. The
locally developed design is eminently suited to its
work. Mr. Fife, the great draughtsman, some years
ago built a yacht on the Clyde for this lake. He
came to see it compete, but the local boats quickly
showed their superiority over the new design.</p>
<p>The engines are now re-starting, and our steamer
cleaves toward Curwens&rsquo;, or Belle Isle, which for
long has seemed to close the way. Now, however,
narrow channels open to both right and left. The
yacht bears right away past two small holmes. One
of these, a cluster of trees and a level sward, is ofttimes
used for kennels for the puppies of the Windermere
harrier pack. Here they are quite at liberty and yet
out of mischief, a remarkable circumstance in a puppy&rsquo;s
career. Often I have laid on the oars to watch the
little hounds romping and playing, under the blinking
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
superintendence of an elder. Then their game would
stop, and a pell-mell of puppydom charge to the
shingles and bay its infantile delight. Belle Isle is
the only island of Windermere on which a house is
now standing. In the long ago a branch of the
Philipsons of Calgarth held it. During the Civil War
this family was Royalist. One, a major in the king&rsquo;s
Northern army, was shut up in Carlisle by the
Roundheads; another was here beleaguered. For
several weeks the men of the Parliament tried to carry
the island by storm, but failed. The major had been
apprised of his brother&rsquo;s peril, and immediately the
siege of the Border city was raised he came south
with a troop and dispersed the Roundheads. Now to
the daring Robert came the hope of reprisals. The
island was fully relieved at Sunday dawn; three hours
later Royalist horsemen were on their way to Kendal.
Colonel Briggs, the Cromwellian commander, attended
divine service regularly. Robert accordingly made
straight into Kendal Church. Though the building
was crowded, he galloped through the tall doorway
and up the aisle. Sword in hand he rode to where
his antagonist usually sat, but Briggs was not at
church. The townsfolk rose, and Robert was forced
to gallop down the other aisle to prevent being
overwhelmed by numbers. The doorway to the right
is lower than the central: Robert&rsquo;s head struck the
arch, and he was thrown. His steel helmet received
most of the concussion, and Robin was on his feet
again in a moment. One townsman caught his horse;
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the saddle girth had broken when the rider had been
hurled backward. Robert instantly threw the saddle
across his charger&rsquo;s back and leapt into it. Suddenly
and cruelly spurred, the horse reared up and jerked the
rein from its detainer&rsquo;s hand, while the intruder clove
him to the chin. Without further interruption, the
Cavaliers rode back to their island fortress.</p>
<p>The steamer has been bearing us through the
narrow channel to Bowness Bay. The scene here is
usually a busy and a pretty one. The public fore-shore
is narrow, and rowboats are crowded toward it.
The steamer-pier and two long jetties make the
narrowness still more emphatic. But Bowness Bay,
with the Old England hotel to our left, looks perfect.
Beyond the short promenade, laid out in trees and
terrace-gardens, the ground rises to rocky Biskey
Howe, whence is a glorious view of the lake.
Quite close at hand is Windermere parish church,
with some stained glass removed here from Cartmel
Priory at the Dissolution. The walls were at one
time decorated with texts, but the Lutherans rebelled
against these and hid them beneath ignoble whitewash.
But what the sixteenth century despised, the twentieth
reveres, and the old Scripture paintings have been
carefully restored. The village of Bowness presents
little noteworthy except its attention to visitors: its
reputation in this respect is thoroughly justified.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OLD FERRY, WINDERMERE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>If you take a walk ashore, the various boatmen will
embarrass you with offers of craft. &ldquo;Fishing tackle?
oh, I&rsquo;ll lend you that with pleasure, and bait too.&rdquo;
Now this is all very well for the disciple of Walton
who insists on having a competent person on board to
select the fishing-ground. But the average man may
be fairly warned by the following note: &ldquo;Hired a
boat for the day and set out to fish with six rods,
plenty of bait, and a hopeful word of success from
the boatman. We cast our lines right and left, back
and front, but not a fish did we see. Whether the
fish or the bait were enchanted we could not say,
but concluded that the lines were lent to make people
believe they could catch fish.&rdquo; In answer I had to
point out (my complainant knew sea and a quiet
variety of river fishing well) that, under a blazing
June sun, perch and trout were not likely to feed.
There are times when the fishing is good&mdash;out of
the tourist season mainly. Some anglers regularly
come to Windermere for sport; but these swallows
do not make a summer, and Windermere is far from
being an angler&rsquo;s paradise yet. The lapsus lingu&aelig;
of the boatmen is perhaps excusable: others delude
in less satisfactory fashion.</p>
<p>Turning again to the bay, with its view of Belle
Isle, and the blue mountains peering over the bluffs
of Furness, it strikes every visitor that the landing-place
is exceedingly cramped. Thousands use the
boats; were the rival proprietors less good-natured
traffic would be impossible. Perennially there is a
movement afoot to acquire additional frontage for the
public use, but as perennially it fails. In the Diamond
Jubilee year, many thought that an acquirement was
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
coming at last. Negotiations were opened for land
to the south of the bay, but the Vicar of Windermere
could not meet the promoters.</p>
<p>Aboard the <i>Swift</i> again, we are borne into the
upper basin. On Lady Holme was once a chapel,
served by the monks of Segden Abbey, one of the
Scotch monasteries. They were in possession so early
as 1355, and till the Dissolution maintained two
priests here. There is, in some old descriptions, a
legend that one of these priests, to mortify his flesh,
caused himself to be chained in the crag above
Rawlinson&rsquo;s Nab, and there he remained for thirty
years or so, before death released him. Sweet in
early May are the islets here with lily of the valley:
at any time it is pleasant to land on them, for they
are dry, their brakes are not tangled&mdash;an ideal place
for a quiet afternoon. As the steamer goes on, the
scene grows in grandeur. Over a vast plain of water
the distant mountains seem to hang. There are misty
indications of level meadows and woodlands next the
water, but the charm lies in the craggy, shaggy braes
and the uprising summits. The woods continue&mdash;larch!
larch! planted in harsh geometrical lines on
the Furness side; the opposite, though really covered
with villas, presents a happy, confused forest of oak
and ash, sycamore, elm, beech, interspersed with
hollies and great patches of underwood. The white
foam of hawthorn flecks these hills in early summer;
later, patches of gorse, in wild, unconsidered corners,
brighten up the heavy green. Then come the heather
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
and the heather bell, empurpling the higher ground;
till September&rsquo;s chilly nights turn the leafage to glories
of gold and crimson, the brackens to red and russet.
We are now opposite Millerground; the lake near
shore is shallow and tempting to the angler.</p>
<p>The hill jutting out above there is Orrest Head&mdash;the
viewpoint of the Lake County. I have no wish
to disparage other of our views: each has its merits.
From Orrest you look up and down the river-lake,
Winandermere, winding through a long valley. Round
the head of its hollow are rugged masses of mountain,
cut into by narrow glens and ghylls. The basins of
Langdale, of Grasmere, with their tarns and lakes,
are hidden in a maze of wildering rocks. Right
opposite, the Furness fells, ridge beyond ridge, till, a
grand barrier, Coniston Old Man heaves skyward,
give no indication of two lakes and wide valleys
embosomed beneath. There are two circumstances
under which they who climb Orrest are especially
well repaid: on a calm June morning, when the lake
like a mirror reflects every detail of the hills, when
the ruffle of a passing boat or steamer dies away on
the dead calm; the other time is when light clouds
are drifting across the sky and you can see dappled
areas floating over water and wood and fell. There
is little to choose between these and when the sun
sinks in a bank of vapour behind the Langdale Pikes.
Instantly a crimson light filters across the upper
basin, picking out bay and islet in a halo of brilliance.
For half an hour it becomes more glorious, then to
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
purple and to grey the light declines. Yet, again,
climb Orrest when thick snow covers the earth. The
scene is awe-inspiring: if in moonlight, you see the
terror and majesty of winter; in sunshine the air is
filled with chill radiance, and the scene invites you
not to despond but to work or play with a will.
But this is not of the steam yacht and the lakeside.</p>
<p>Opposite us, with its big round chimneys, is
Calgarth, the mansion of the Philipsons. There is
nothing now to distinguish it from the Calvegarth
it originally was. If the place was ever fortified,
all traces of such, save its thick walls, have disappeared.
The house has the reputation of being
haunted, for the misdeeds of a Naboth. Desiring
land in the possession of an old couple, he had
them convicted for theft. The old woman, who had
occult power, pronounced seven curses against the
Philipsons. The couple were duly hung at Appleby,
but their skulls came home to Calgarth ere morning
light. And at Calgarth they have remained, though
men have calcined them with lime, cast them into
the lake, and buried them on the mountains. Horrible
sounds were heard, groanings and shriekings and
wild lament, after any tampering with the uncanny
things; so, to prevent further trouble, they were built
into the wall&mdash;and few now believe in their existence.
There are other mysteries hereabout too. When
grievous trouble is at hand, a spectral white horse
passes over the lake from shore to shore. And
occasionally the wanderer&rsquo;s eye is caught by a faint
iris on the water, rivalling in its clear tinges the
very rainbow. Both phenomena are said to be well
vouched for, which, I presume, has made it not
essential for the present writer to witness them.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

<p class="caption">OLD LABURNUMS AT NEWBY BRIDGE, WINDERMERE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Above Calgarth is the great glen of Troutbeck,
where many illustrious personages, from Hugh Bird,
a giant of Henry III.&rsquo;s time, downward, have lived.
Hogarth, the weird painter of sordid life, was born
here, and at one time the sign of the old Mortal
Man inn was held to be his work: a very free
drawing it was, of a burly man with vermilion nose,
confronted by a thin, white-visaged stranger, with
the couplets:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, Mortal Man, who lives on bread,</p>
<p class="t0">How came thy nose to be so red?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou silly ass, that art so pale,</p>
<p class="t0">It is with drinking Birkett&rsquo;s ale.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Till within the last half-century Troutbeck was a
&rsquo;statesman dale, but few of the yeomen are now left.
They were not noted fighters, like the men to northward,
but in self-defence they manned a fort which an
obscure generation had built in Thresthwaite Cove at
the head of the valley. The last time was in 1745,
when a small band of Scotch rebels were sent back
&ldquo;wi&rsquo; a flee in ther lugs.&rdquo; The grey mansion in the
park was built by Bishop Watson, of Llandaff. Westmorland-born,
he loved his homeland, and during a
forty years&rsquo; reign he ruled his bishopric from thence.
There is but one mention in his Life and Letters of
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
his going to Wales. Yet he preached strongly to
those of his clergy who were absent too much from
their livings!</p>
<p>The most prominent building now in sight is
Wray Castle. This is not old. In one of his interesting
colloquies on angling and things in general,
Dr. John Davy, in a book published shortly after
the building was completed, remarks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wray Castle is altogether a modern building, and
erected by its present proprietor and inhabitant, who
has too much knowledge of sanitary conditions to
surround himself with stagnant water, making an
enemy to health where there is no fear of neighbouring
hostility. As to the structure itself we need not
criticise it; it is well placed, and at a distance may
well pass for what you supposed it to be&rdquo; (a moated
stronghold), &ldquo;and have the desired effect on the
uninformed mind and the careless eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the steamer approaches Lowwood, and the
coppices of Wansfell sheer up in feathery grandeur
as we sail inshore. The view from the hotel attracted
Ruskin on his first visit as a child of ten, and in
his rhyming diary he speaks of his impatience to be
at the windows enjoying the glorious view. The
lake is here at its widest and deepest; from shore
to shore the distance is considerably over a mile,
with a depth approaching two hundred feet. The
boats out on the water are fishing for char with the
cumbrous implement known as the plumb-line. Char
feed at varying depths; to-day the shoal may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
within ten feet of the surface, to-morrow near a
hundred feet lower. The instrument used is made
up of a long central line heavily weighted, to which
tiers of smaller lines are attached at intervals. By
this means the fish are tempted at all levels, but the
implement is for the professional rather than the
amateur. The tiers of hooks and baits are sure to
foul one another if not dexterously handled.</p>
<p>As the steam yacht gets under way again, Dove
Nest, once the abode of Mrs. Hemans, is seen
peering through the woods climbing Wansfell. The
poetess ever fondly remembered her sojourn here,
and the friends she made among the Lakeland poets.
Some of the finest contemporary appreciations, both
of personalities and work, came from her pen.</p>
<p>Passing Hen Holme, a spine of rock sticking out
into the lake&mdash;how the waves from the screw lash
and dash against its ledges!&mdash;the yacht carries us
into open lake again. What a panorama of mountains!</p>
<p>Wansfell rises to the right; beyond is the gap
of the pass and Kirkstone fell. Red Screes presents
its tamer slope, and looks not half so commanding
as less lofty Scandale Pike. The long ridge of
Fairfield, its ghylls raw with floods and winter storms,
comes next, standing above Rydal park. Along this
group, a century ago, wild red deer used to range;
there was a herd on the Ullswater fells, as now, and
also in the wildernesses about Eskdale and Ennerdale.
The long slope bending downward to Nab Scar is
Great Rigg. You can see only the head of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
precipitous Scar, for the bracken-covered heights of
Loughrigg climb to the skyline. At square with
our course are the Langdale Pikes, their strange
knotty summits showing up finely. Great Gable
peeps from beyond Borrowdale; Great End, Scawfell
Pike, and Scawfell glance through gaps in the rugged
chain stretching from Bowfell to Wrynose pass. The
country beneath these is the famous Langdales, land
of tarns and ghylls, crags and screes. From Wetherlam
westward is the Coniston range, haunt of the raven
and other wild birds. The head of Windermere is
particularly glorious: fir-crowned Fisher Crag sets
off the levels where Brathay and Rothay sloom into
the lake. The sharp spire of St. Katharine&rsquo;s, according
to Mrs. Hemans, was foundationed for a
square tower. Ambleside creeps in rows and terraces
up Wansfell, but the grey stone is harmonious and
the red ridge-tiles at this distance invisible. To the
left Fox Howe stands on its sentry-hill; the views
from its lawns are fine: to northward into the heart
of the mountains, and the wild forest of Rydal;
southerly, green lowland and the silvern mass of
Windermere right down to where islands close the
view. The level next the river-mouth was at one time
a Roman camp, but nothing to prove its name has
yet been discovered. Medals and coins are sometimes,
after heavy floods, cast up out of the mere. The
Rothay was diverted somewhat by the camp builders,
that the rectangle they favoured might be preserved.
The camp was doubtless used as a caravansery for
the traffic between Brougham on the Eamont and
the seaport of Ravenglass. Both places are, if
mountain roads have not altered for the worse, a
good day&rsquo;s journey away: one over the lofty passes
of Wrynose and Hard Knott, the other over the
elevated road along High Street. Cultivation has
robbed the earthwork of distinctness, but enough
remains to show dimly its angles and extent.</p>

<p>Now the quiet rumble of the screw stops; the yacht
sails smoothly and accurately to her berth. Outside
the pier a concourse of conveyances is in waiting,
and we see our fellow passengers melt away by
common &rsquo;bus or lordly pair to their respective
destinations. The water here is crowded with craft,
but there is not the terrible congestion we saw at
Bowness bay. A long curve of shingle is open to
the public, and forms a favourite promenade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small"><i>BY WORDSWORTH&rsquo;S ROTHAY</i></span></h2>
<p>Even during the height of summer there are
dull days sometimes, when dense clouds simply
stifle the dales in gloom. This is the more tantalising
when one is at Ambleside in the midst of the beauties
of Lakeland.</p>
<p>But after two o&rsquo;clock the day became perceptibly
brighter; Loughrigg discovered itself opposite our
window, a kindly precipice of damp grey crags rearing
through a forest of dwarf oaks and clinging ash, green
plumed larches and verdant undergrowth, its long
crest crowned with patches of heather and wide,
quivering wastes of bracken. There is little to interest
us in Ambleside: the sun is bursting his cloudy
bonds, and we chafe at streets and houses! Out, then,
on the Rydal road, past the old moss-grown mill
and the bridge-house Ruskin sketched in his youth,
past the Knoll where Harriet Martineau lived. Now
we rejoice to see a riven cloud turn to gleaming
silver at its edges, and through the gap a shaft of
light strikes down to earth. It is lost! No, there
it is again, kissing the rugged crest of Nab Scar,
and hovering along its flank. The clouds above whirl
together, and the welcome gleam is cut off. But the
upper heavens are overpent with sunshine; glance
after glance of glory dances down and melts away
on Loughrigg fell. For half an hour gloom and
coming sunshine wage unequal warfare, then the
clouds to westward break up their solid phalanx,
and wider and more frequent are the wheeling spokes
of light. Here one blazons a scree-drifted hillside,
there one peers and glances into a rocky ghyll.
Broad streams of radiance flow into unseen abysms
beyond the nearer mountain curtain, a flash of refreshing
brilliance lights up acres of rugged scrub.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>By the rivulet we see the usual patient angler.
Men there are so entranced in seeking to lure the
trout, that they brave rain or shine indifferently.
Under the hazels, when booming gusts clash walls
of rain against mountain and bosky meadow, they
still angle on; under the hazels you find them when
from a sky of staring blue the sun beats down on
a drought-struck land. This brook from happy,
lonely Scandale holds many a small brown trout; its
bed is bright and shingly, with clean swirling pools
and glinting, tinkling rapids. The road now enters
Rydal park; miles of rough land stretch toward the
lofty ridge from which a cloud is drifting slowly.
The sun has now the victory, pouring a flood of
joyous light on a scene of unparalleled beauty, and
this fleecy, crawling monster is the rearguard of
departed gloom.</p>
<p>Near a fir-crowned hillock we see a picturesque
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
group of mountain ponies. The Le Flemings of the
Hall have ever been upholders of these useful little
animals, going to great trouble and expense to improve
the breed. The well-selected Rydal stallions are
admired in the dales for miles around. The farmers
are not keen to part with their best stock, so the
standard, though not yet entirely satisfactory, is
creeping upward. Rydal beck hurries beneath the
bridge, bank-full, its tiny surges shaking the plumy
water-grass, whipping the too-pendant branches.
The Rothay, close to our left, is a greater volume,
but calmer, clear and shining where the sunlight
dapples through the wych-elms, darkling in deep pools
in the dense oak shade. The stream carries flakes
of foam, and from ahead we hear the water purling
down a rocky channel.</p>
<p>A few yards on, at Pelter bridge, a cross-road
passes under Loughrigg. Looking up-stream, from the
parapet, it is a lovely confusion: the beck, overhung
with tall sycamores, ashes, and oaks, is split into tiny
currents, each babbling its merry way down through
a maze of boulders. Some of these are crowned with
grass, over which in due season dangle the dainty blue
harebell, the yellow-irised oxeyes, the crimson-spiked
foxglove, or the blue-orbed sundew. In the margins
goldilocks show dark tufts of leaves; when these are
in bloom, the waterside is gay with brilliant yellow.
Some of the river-stones are decked with moss&mdash;the
gurgling, dashing streamlet occasionally tosses a tiny jet
of spray to gem the glossy crowns. After a long spell of
drought Rothay shrinks almost from view in this
labyrinth of pool, wee cascade, and calmer channel.
The riverside is almost too beautiful to lift the eyes
from, but a sharp crag of Loughrigg sheers against
a rosy cloud of eventide to our left, and on our right
the great green mass of Nab Scar almost overhangs
the cottage in front.</p>

<p>A cottage by Rothay! Wordsworth&rsquo;s Rothay! In
far-off climes and dusty, choking cities many pause
in their eternal soul-grinding struggle and think of
such sweet retirements, even when the scene is merely
a figment conjured up by the poet&rsquo;s craft. To such
as know Rothay from its source in the craggy fells
to slooming Winander, the feeling of envy is more
acute. It is a glorious stretch of country, alike calm
and beautiful, stormy and forbidding; in spring
tinged with delicate green, in summer wreathed in
blossom of pink and white and blue; in autumn
shot with crimson and gold of dying leafage; in
winter grey and dank with rain, or garmented in
dazzling snow. But the cottage!&mdash;clung with the
bines of creepers and eaved with glossy ivy; the
lowly little cot where the tallest hollyhock peeps
in at the chamber window; the old-fashioned garden
laid out in neat beds of showy or sweet-scented flowers,
with gay gladioli spikes of puce and white, and
fuchsias red and outbending, with balsam and balm and
the sweetest thyme; the rockery with green caressing
films of parsley fern, the smooth tongues of scolopendrium,
and the broad palmated fronds and upstanding
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
brown &ldquo;flowers&rdquo; of the royal fern, with the wiry,
graceful forms of oak and more robust-looking holly
ferns; the wall-garden where white rocket, yellow
musk, and a few hardy plants flourish, with rare
mosses garnishing their fountains of bloom, and the
half-wild turmoil of king-cups and &ldquo;cross-buns&rdquo; in
the miniature pool of the Rothay. But the cottage!&mdash;with
twisty oaken beams in the ceil of the parlour,
with dark recesses and low windows, with a wide
fireplace, to which, when winter&rsquo;s roar and rain and
snow run riot without, the chairs can be drawn
and the many-houred evening drift away in happy
talk and song and merriment. &ldquo;Plain living and
high thinking&rdquo;&mdash;one could almost realise the ideal
in such a home, where the fare is the humble,
wholesome product of our mountain land; where
thin haver-bread, tough, sweet cheese, and warm, pure
milk might form the staple food; a home where
the spinning-wheel might awaken from silence and
dusty limbo, and give a perfect employment; where
linen and wool might be worked up to thread and
yarn in quiet hours. Such a prospect is fair beyond
words, but few of us will ever dwell&mdash;save in our
roseate dreams, by day or night&mdash;in a cottage by
Wordsworth&rsquo;s Rothay.</p>
<p>After a time spent beneath the trees and by the
gushing waters, where viewpoints ever more fair
allure us from one coign to another, we return to
the road, here avenued by giant beeches. The
western light touches a moving cloud, the damp,
coppery leaves below catch the glow and throw it in
a myriad little sparkles from twig to branch, and
from branch to smooth bole. What is there in Nature
more glorious than a group of well-grown trees?</p>

<p>Wordsworth&rsquo;s connection with the hamlet of
Rydal is well known. In his pretty cottage on the
hill he lived a life apart from the dalesfolk, watching
the seasons come and go over the beautiful glen.
Through the little knot of houses, we shortly
approach the mere. Right up to Silver Howe the
basin is brimmed with light; mountain and wood and
lake are at &ldquo;the pride of day.&rdquo; Evening, sweet
and slow, is dropping nearer, its first sign the grey-blue
mist hovering beyond the bordering hills. The
crag on which the Laureate of the Fells often sat
commands a good view of the lake, and of a huge
gash in Loughrigg, whence comes the sound of
tinkling slate, where the quarry thunders ring. This
of course was not so prominent in Wordsworth&rsquo;s
day. The cottage at Nab where Hartley Coleridge
lived, loved by the dalesman (as his master was
almost shunned), comes next: here De Quincey afterwards
resided some opium-cursed years. We wander
by the reedy mere, noting the islet on which not
so long ago herons used to nest among the tangled
trees, then take the road again for home.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that so many see Lakeland from
its main ways only. They realise its narrow
bounds, but cannot justly appreciate its rare beauties.
For a week or two such travel our macadam roads;
they climb the most frequented mountains, visit ghylls
and tarns and waterfalls, wander by the favourite
lakes: then away they pass, believing doubtless that
Lakeland offers nothing further. Could they but
come again, and discover our wealth of bypaths!
Why I, a native of and dweller upon the soil, have
spent the leisure of a dozen years and more in
exploring without wearying, and know that many
corners remain unvisited. To those who have seen
Lakeland in hurried guise, I would say come again,
avoid the sights noted in prose and verse, go elsewhere
where you will, and at the end you may feel, with
me, that less-known scenes make the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; look
not unlike the watery dregs of the milk-pail.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>On a cloudy morning we came to Rydal and turned
up the road to Wordsworth&rsquo;s home in old age. At
Rydal Mount he produced some of his most characteristic
poetry&mdash;short pieces such as &ldquo;The Clouds&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Mountain Echo&rdquo;; at Dove Cottage &ldquo;The
Excursion&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Prelude&rdquo; were penned. In
Wordsworth&rsquo;s day the road in the glen did not send
up an almost ceaseless clatter, and seldom did the
steam plume by Waterhead pier meet his sight. The
poet had an aversion to the larch-tree, an exotic then
being planted extensively in the dales, and did not
care much for steam and the work of the engineer.
The trees in stiff lines and squares make hideous the
mountain slopes to-day; but see them growing in
romantic irregularity, as by Thirlmere, and you will
believe that Wordsworth might have conceded a beauty
to the larch. And there are things more hideous
than steam&mdash;for instance, the petrol motor. Rydal
Mount is not a museum: its grounds are kept private.
It is a simple dales dwelling in design&mdash;round chimneys,
lead-glazed windows, grey walls without, low-ceiled,
raftered rooms within: its well-planned gardens are
the only characteristic to mark it from many other
abode of &ldquo;the bettermer mak&rdquo; of yeoman folk.
Enthusiasts often run up from the road to peep over
its shrubs and gate, but most tourists go heedlessly
by this retreat of the aged poet. From the garden
where the poet composed his verses&mdash;&ldquo;bumming and
booing to hissel,&rdquo; says one who recollects him clearly:
&ldquo;bum&mdash;bum&mdash;bum&mdash;bum, and at every bum he maid
a step forrit, mebbe six or sebben steps; then roond
he wad whirrel and gang back&mdash;bum, bum, bum,&mdash;happen
just as many times. It didn&rsquo;t matter to him
whether he wor in his ane garden or on t&rsquo; fell or on
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
t&rsquo; roo-ad,&rdquo;&mdash;there is a grand view. Down the glen to
the lake, darkling under the massed clouds, over the
woods of Rydal and a corner of the mere, Loughrigg
and, dimly seen through rolling mists, Crinkle Crags
and Bowfell. Would that a gleam of sunshine would
kindle the grey and brown and dull red of dale and
fellside to silver and russet, crimson and gold! For
it is late September, and the glory of autumn is
about us.</p>
<p>I have read many &ldquo;interviews&rdquo; with the aged
Wordsworth. Some writers have seen him in idealism;
others in a matter-of-fact light. A third class, bent
on decrying his worth, have conjured up overheated
visions of an uncultivated, unmannered man, calling
to question his genius, his mode of living, his person.
But some humble scribe, long before the poet was
removed by death, penned the following. He had
no difficulty in reaching the Laureate; a request at
the door of Rydal Mount for a short interview was
answered by the poet himself. &ldquo;He took me by
the hand in a way that did me good. There was
welcome in his words and looks as well as in the
shake of his hand, and in less than five minutes he
was taking me round his fairy dwelling-place and
pointing out to me the most striking objects of the
beautiful and glowing scenes around. He was rather
tall and thin, with a countenance somewhat pale, and
more thoughtful than joyous. Simple and courteous
in his demeanour, and frank in his remarks, he made
me feel at ease. He was just the man that I had
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
imagined him to be from reading his &lsquo;Excursion.&rsquo;&rdquo;
The same writer, looking into an ivied and moss-grown
unused quarry near White Moss, expressed
his pleasure at the sight. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; was the poet&rsquo;s
response, &ldquo;all might find these secluded temples of
beauty, but all will not give themselves the trouble
to seek them.&rdquo; The path which cuts along the
breast of Nab Scar turns to the left just above
the poet&rsquo;s home, between it and Hart Head, name
reminiscent of days when its holder was forester on
Rydal fells to Le Flemings of old. Looking ahead,
we see a rough road climbing up to as wild a piece
of fell land as we have. It is another haunt of the
shepherd, a land bleak and wild&mdash;the ravines of Rydal
Head and the great crags of Fairfield, fit home for
wild red deer. Fit home too for the half-wild, little
Herdwick, that atom of sturdiness fit to live in a land
of storm. Two months hence there will be a day of
days in wild Rydal, when the shepherds clear their
heafs of the flocks. The work begins ere daybreak,
and lasts sometimes into the night following. The
sheep dogs, obedient to the calls of their masters,
range the whole fellsides very completely, driving
down the sheep as they are detected in ghyll or by
bog. The work is arduous for both men and dogs,
the exact equivalent of the work in miles and altitude
ascended being often tremendous.</p>
<p>Our way, however, is smoother, easier than this.
We skirt the grounds of Rydal Mount: from a higher
bank we look over its round chimneys on to the green
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
glen below, on to Windermere, the river-lake, winding
away between bluffs bronzed with fading foliage, to be
lost at last in the heart of them; we look along the
rocky edge of Loughrigg, where the dying bracken
shows the approach of autumn. We are walking in
a forest of stumpy oak-trees, the twisted heads of which
speak eloquently of the power of the winter gales on
this exposed fell-end: below us, with its long, narrow,
wooded islet almost dividing it into two portions,
is Rydalmere. From the outlet in Rothay to swampish
White Moss it is in full sight, and of a kindlier hue than
was chill Winander, which a corner of Loughrigg has
now shut from sight. The breaking mass of cloud over
Langdale Pikes is letting in the full day. On the
road beneath, even thus early, the mad race of vehicles
has begun. No one seems to be able to go slowly
by Rydalmere, save the lumbering carrier&rsquo;s cart. Once
all the ordinary passenger traffic of the country was
carried on these slow conveyances&mdash;I can see a merit
in the method now. The coaches sweep you along
at a fast trot; one gasps at new things that are gone
ere he comprehends their beauty. And now we have
motor-traffic, a series of giant &rsquo;buses followed by so
many pillars of dust as though they held out the
rallying signals for a world of traffic; these excel all
in soul-destroying haste.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Our path clears the woodlands; there is now an
uninterrupted view of the lake. Above the farmstead
where De Quincey and Hartley Coleridge lived,
the folks are busy making hay. In our glens this,
the only harvest, is of great importance: unless it is
well secured the supplies of winter forage for the
flocks are scant and often much suffering is caused.
The flocks are kept on the lowlands till late May,
so that the crop is not sufficiently grown to be cut
until late August and sometimes September. At
that period the weather is so apt to be unsettled that,
when once the grass is mown, almost superhuman
efforts have to be made to house it. A few hours
lost may mean that the farmer has to watch his crop
soaking and wasting for a fortnight or more. My
Southron reader will hardly believe that not infrequently
whole fields of hay cannot be gathered
in and are utterly lost on account of foul weather;
in wet 1903, the acres of Lakeland meadows which
yielded no crops for this reason, to the writer&rsquo;s
knowledge numbered thousands; and instances of
carting the hay on sunny days in November, December,
and even January were woefully frequent.</p>
<p>A little way ahead the path passes into a wilder
scene. The woods close in from below; above,
the brackens sway over a maze of broken, downthrown
stones. The foot of the cliff is not many
feet above, a block of limestone broken into by
narrow spits of grass and bleached tongues of scree.
Among the rocks a few sheep are feeding; as we
approach they rush away, picking their way accurately
and neatly over the debris at a great pace.
Hereabouts on a winter&rsquo;s morning you may be fortunate
enough to surprise a fox, blinking and slinking away
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
to some deep hold in the mountain after a night&rsquo;s
marauding. Every score yards gives a fresh view,
a new angle of vision to the glen, the lake, and
Loughrigg scattered o&rsquo;er with purple waste of stones.
Here we come to White Moss of the three roads,
from which Dr. Arnold took his famous political
allegory. That way twisting up through the boulders,
climbing steeply and ruggedly over the top of the hill,
well-nigh impossible to wheeled traffic, was his Old
Corruption. Here another route swings up the hill,
on a level keel certainly, but it climbs a great height
and is far from easy&mdash;that was his Bit-by-bit Reform.
Along a bold terrace a third road sweeps; it
surveys the knot in front, passes the foot of Old
Corruption with a puzzled glance as to what manner
of man prefers such tortuous ways, comes to Bit-by-bit
Reform and has half a mind to go that way, then
remembers its destiny to carry traffic without labour
or danger, and curves into the pass, avoiding the
knot altogether&mdash;Radical Reform&mdash;scotching the hill
of Privilege and Abuse. The cottage on the hillside
is the home of our most noted trail-hound trainer,
Steve Walker. A word as to his craft is not amiss
as we near Grasmere, the home of fell-head sports.
True lovers of the hound genus, the dalesmen are not
content to let them slip out of sight in the summer,
so have evolved a mimic fox-chase with a scent of
aniseed. The course is laid round a rough daleside,
the hounds loosed. It would be impossible for the
fleetest horse to live long with them over such terrific
ground. A circuit of six miles is often covered in
little over the half hour. To train the hounds to
so great pace is a recognised craft, and Steve often has
half a dozen hounds in his hands for different owners.
It is not an unusual sight to see three of his charges
running neck and neck for the blue riband of the
sport at Grasmere. The training is severe; pace
is required and also strength and staying power. The
food given is plain and strong; several hours each
day are devoted to outdoor exercise. The trainer
with his leash of hounds is a frequent sight on the
Lake Country byways. Twice or thrice a week
the hounds are put over a short trial course and their
progress noted with care. The sport has a fascination
for the dalesman-born, and I must not dwell too
much upon it.</p>

<p class="caption">SUNSET, RYDAL WATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Grasmere Lake will shortly be visible over the
tree-tops, but we seek a more striking approach.
Therefore, sinking the hillside, we cross White
Moss, down to the footbridge spanning the prattling
Rothay. It is an angler&rsquo;s path we tread; this
length of water should be famous, for white-headed
rodsmen tell legends of mighty trout, up to
twenty pounds weight, which used to come from
Windermere and Rydalmere to spawn upon the
beaches here. Shortly the wood is cleared, the
sunlight is touching Helm Crag in steady blaze; it
comes forward to Silver Howe, and in a few seconds
the rushing rivulet by our side is sending out myriad
sparkles of glory. The sky has cleared, and there
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
is prospect of a fairer day. The lake of Grasmere
lies in a perfect basin, and, though its sweet retirement
is somewhat marred by too many buildings, yet the
glen for a greater part of the year remains a pleasant
nook. From the shingle we stand upon, the head of
the Rothay ravine, there is a beautiful view. In front,
Silver Howe, to its right Helm Crag, then Steel fell,
the gap of Dunmail, Seat Sandal and the stony backs
of Rydal fells; beneath them are many lower hills,
cut into by tiny level glens and narrow watercourses.
But this sunny autumn morn the eye takes in the
atmosphere of the scene even more than its component
features. Thus the peaks soaring into the gleaming
air become less important than the glorious woods
at their feet. Autumn&rsquo;s gorgeous art is vivid on fell
and wood and meadow. The beauty of the scene lies
in Nature&rsquo;s harmonious blendings, and one feels that
only the poet&rsquo;s imagery can describe the scene. Silver
Howe is pictured in two-thirds the width of Grasmere;
at our feet a feathery cloudlet sails in a second sky.
So clear, so perfect, the counterfeit that even the
charming mystery of height remains. The summit
curving against autumnal blue, the purple crags, the
screes, here grey, there blue, there a finer tinge where
rock, grass, and heather meet, the turgid flood of
colour where the bracken is dying, the solid green of
the larch woods, the softer plumes of birch, the fiery
oaks, the fading green meadows, are all in this
peaceful mirror.</p>
<p>There is a chunking of oars, and shortly across our
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
range of vision there swings a small boat; it grounds
a few yards away, a boat from the hotel carrying a
visitor to the Loughrigg side. We hail the boatman,
and in a few seconds have hired him to take us out on
to the lake awhile. What a splendid picture the glen
makes from the island! The village church towers
above a knot of grey buildings across the meadows; the
hills around all seem to be higher; the feast of colour
is even finer than that seen from the foot of the lake.
Above the eastern shore the woods, a paradise of
varied tints, lit up by the bright sun, rise to the
Wishing Gate. Then back again we are rowed.
There are plenty of brackens here to give a flush to
the hillside, but we avoid their tangle. Among the
boulders the hardy sheep are grazing; no other
animal could nibble and thrive on the short, slippery
grass of the uplands. As we turn, the lake seems
to have narrowed; really more of the level valley is
in sight, and the mountains are discovering themselves
in their true magnitude. When Red Bank
is reached, the view is at its widest; over the gap
of Dunmail is seen a blue portion of Skiddaw forest.
As a dalesman, it must be confessed that I am
somewhat impatient with our &ldquo;show&rdquo; scenes; they
tell me few stories, arouse few reminiscences. It is
on a foxhunt that my memory pauses, when we
streamed off over the rough slopes toward Silver
Howe&mdash;a grey day of winter, not a morning in
full autumn. One sees but little of the lake in
descending to Grasmere village, just outside which
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
is Pavement End, reminiscent of our &ldquo;Sports.&rdquo;
Here for at least thirty years was held our great
athletic festival&mdash;the &ldquo;Derby of the Dales.&rdquo; Here
were seen our fell runners, our pole leapers, our
trail hounds, our wrestlers in the true mountain
style. The course of the old fell race was up the
rough hillside, &ldquo;that precipice,&rdquo; as our Southron friends
call it. Had I space I would say much on this
topic; the sports are held on another field now, and&mdash;shades
of the past, you giant athletes of Cumbria!&mdash;the
race is now run on less difficult ground across
the glen.</p>
<p>At Grasmere, beneath the yews of the kirk-garth,
the poet Wordsworth is buried. Rothay murmurs
near by. The church is not yet &ldquo;restored,&rdquo; and
remains simple as in the days of Wordsworth.
There is a pretty custom here (and in other dales)
known as &ldquo;the rush-bearing.&rdquo; Many years ago our
chapels were not floored with timber, the earth was
merely pressed hard by the use of generations.
Damp struck up on wet days, and chill in winter,
which rendered worship uncomfortable. Rushes were
therefore strewn on the floor at the approach of
winter. Time went on, the earthen floor was
superseded: instead of the old gathering of rushes
for use a festival has been inaugurated. The children
of the glen weave rushes into crosses and bouquets,
go in procession to the church and lay their
offerings by the altar there.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Grasmere is in itself without especial charm to the
visitor. It is too busy to grow beautiful; romance
has stayed away, commercialism reigns, and I for
one do not care a fig for the place outside its connection
with the poet, with its great possession,
his grave and its grey-towered church. But Grasmere
as a centre for rambles is unparalleled.</p>
<p>My last glimpse of Grasmere was in wintry weather,
and from the Wishing Gate. No snow had fallen;
the frost-rime covered the valley with white, though
the southern facets of the uplands, on which the sun
had spent its feeble power, were stiff bronze. The
lake was partly frozen, the westering light gleamed
on ice and the dark patches of water here and there.
The woods, last seen glorious with autumn tints,
were now sere and thin. The silence was divine:
no rumbling car passed on the road beneath, no
sound of voice broke the spell. And bending over the
frosted bars of the gate I wished Grasmere&rsquo;s peace
and content&mdash;and mine own. Turning away at length
to pass over to sweet Rydal Water,&mdash;oh! banished
was the dream from my mind, for a house new-built
on the moor-edge peeps curious eyes through
the plantations at the sacred corner of the Wishing
Gate. Truly it is a commanding site; perhaps the
owner is proud of a choice which gives him views
of Grasmere and Rydal, Loughrigg and the Wishing
Gate&mdash;I cannot justly rail at him, but my
unreason wishes his dwelling far hence. From the
ridge, with the level sunbeams around you, leaving
the hollows veiled in misty blue, you look down upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Rydalmere. Skimmed over with ice, except where
busy rills keep open a few yards&rsquo; space, its levels steely
hard, with a few skaters gliding among its islets, with
brown coppice and white fields rising around, with the
towering front of Nab Scar frowning at the softer
slacks of Loughrigg, Rydal was a sight to remember.
But its glory was all forgotten as I noticed the
frost flowers in the roadside&mdash;are Nature&rsquo;s largest or
her smallest forms the loveliest? Is the spreading
landscape as full of beauty as the flowers formed by
frost rime round a casual sod in the wayside? I
know not, nor care.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small"><i>ESTHWAITE WATER AND OLD HAWKSHEAD</i></span></h2>
<p>If, after a complete survey of our Lakes, one is
asked which could be spared, there is little doubt
that often Esthwaite Water would be the one selected:
so uncharacteristic is it, so unlike the rest of the
country. It is a lowland mere strayed into a district
of crag and brae and foaming rivulet. I don&rsquo;t wish
to agree with such an opinion, for Esthwaite has its
real beauties.</p>
<p>Esthwaite mere certainly possesses no bold scenery;
its shores are regular, its bays sweep in smooth
curves among the meadows. No ridges of rock jut
into its waters, its shores are smooth and shingly.
Esthwaite is the weediest, reediest of our Lakes, and
at places absolutely the quietest, though a great main
road runs close beside. But the vale of Esthwaite,
with its old village of Hawkshead, is worth of notice.
In no other case is there so much to be said about
the locality and so little about the lake. High
Furness has ever been wild and retired. After
Domesday it was given to the Baron of Kendal as
a chase for deer&mdash;possibly because the country was
uninhabitable at that time. Then great Furness
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Abbey arose, and obtained a wide right over this
country-side. The Old Hall at Hawkshead was the
home of the monks when they came to collect their
tithes and harvests. With the fall of the monastery
the Sandys family leapt to ascendancy. One Sandys
in King Edward VI.&rsquo;s time became Archbishop of
York, and used his interest to procure a market,
by royal charter, for the town, which thereupon began
to flourish considerably. This Sandys also gave the
old grammar school its foundation. The church on
the hillside, standing like a watchtower above the grey
roofs, owes much to the Sandys&rsquo;s beneficence, but its
interior is to the casual observer somewhat dull. Its
register, giving a list of Burials in Woollen, is very
complete, that curious old law passed to aid the
woollen industry being rigidly observed for long in
these parts.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>To deal with present-day Hawkshead, there is
the old church on high, its God&rsquo;s acre now spreading
from the narrow promontory on to the swelling
hillside behind, the grammar school where Wordsworth
was educated, and many an old house built
in a fashion now long abandoned. There are curious
nooks here and there, particularly near the church.
One house, built with its upper story protruding on
stone pillars to form a sort of penthouse, tells that here
in happier days the &ldquo;garn&rdquo; or yarn was displayed,
within the hum of the busy spinning-wheels, to the
intending purchaser. To picture Hawkshead in its
prime of two centuries ago is not easy. Though
land was plentiful and even lay waste, the rigours
of manorial law made it impossible to spread out
environs on the sumptuous scale we are accustomed
to to-day, so the little community was herded into
the least possible space. Houses were built as near
together as possible, with narrow entries not two yards
wide passing between the squares; the main street was
hardly broad enough to enable a coach to be driven
along without fear of fouling some outstanding wall.
Sunlight and fresh air were strangers, sanitary
arrangements were nil, roadways, of natural earth, had
a powerful range of suction assimilating sooner or
later the masses of garbage thrown from door and
window. Within the houses, ceilings were low: a
tall man could not stand erect in the loftiest chamber.
Stairways and passages were troublesome things to
build, said our forefathers; so, when building the
penthouse over the shop, many left the upper portion
open, to form a ladder-reached balcony from which
the sleeping apartments could be attained. What the
huge rounded chimneys were intended for is almost
a puzzle. The open fires, with that immense draught
at work, could hardly throw off much heat, and
firelight was an illuminant not favoured by our forefathers.
All cooking was done in pans hanging over
the burning fuel. One real attribute the spacious
chimney had, and has. Across its throat, from bars,
could hang whole sheep to be cured by &ldquo;smoking.&rdquo;
Hung mutton, from a chamber fed with smoke of
wood or peat, is hardly unknown even now in our
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
wilder dales. The roofs without were slated with
thin slabs of soft stone, locally quarried, for the
hard grey slate was not discovered for the purpose
then. Down the streets and across them at various
places babbled tiny streams which, in their courses
from the hills, alighted on the town. To pass these
in time of flood, footbridges were provided for men,
but how the great coaches managed to drive across
their deep channels is a mystery. Looked at from
a distance then, even more than now, Hawkshead
would look like a grey blotch in the landscape.
Though its population was more than at present,
the old town was hardly half the width of the present
one. One must have walked through streets with
huddled houses on either hand awhile, then at once
and completely have emerged into God&rsquo;s country.
The houses were close, mouldy, filthy erections, and
the ignorance of the people was so great that these
were preferred. The idea that anything could be more
healthy than those f&oelig;tid rooms, poisonous smells,
and filthy drinking-water!</p>

<p class="caption">AN OLD STREET IN HAWKSHEAD</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>In those days, too, hundreds of acres near the lake
were swampy and almost impassable: there are many
items in the accounts of the old town for maintenance
of causeways across. The river was spanned
by a wooden bridge, at first for foot passengers only,
while the pack-ponies with merchandise ventured the
ford. The vale of Esthwaite sweeps quietly down
from the rugged hillocks behind Outgate in a wide
sweep to the water&rsquo;s head. The only building of
historic merit outside the town is the Old Hall, now
being used as an ignoble barn or granary. The walls
remaining have been part of the gatehouse; tremendously
thick are they, with narrow stairs climbing
inside solid columns of stone, and with a fine fourteenth
century fireplace in the upper room. The vale
of Esthwaite has no story of war: the Scottish raiders
never penetrated so far aside into the mountain land,
and successive invasions by Romans, Picts, Norsemen,
Saxon, and Norman have been without memorable
strife, and hardly a legend of such actions remains.
Near the head of the lake is the pool known as
Priest&rsquo;s Pot. No streams enter it, none leave, but
the oozy ground around carries into it a sufficiency
of water. It might, from the name, once have been
used as a fish stew; though such a thing is unlikely,
for the monks would have more convenient
waters. In the Priest&rsquo;s Pot was for years a floating
islet, but there is now pointed out a bunch of sallows
on a tuft of mossy grass against the edge of the
pool, which has grown part of the mainland. The
locals say that the Priest&rsquo;s Pot is the measure of a
certain dead-and-gone parish priest&rsquo;s appetite for
strong ale. Not a hundred yards from the Priest&rsquo;s
Pot is the meeting-house at Colthouse, founded in
the early days of Quakerism. In Claife are one
or two notable farmhouses, but nothing possessing
a story. One of the grey farms on the other side
of the glen was for centuries the home of the Sandys.</p>
<p>There are boats available on Esthwaite mere, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
the fishing is strictly preserved. For a shilling fee a
day you are permitted to take coarse fish only. Pike
are plentiful enough at some places, and many a
trimmer is set in defiance of regulations. A summer
afternoon spent on Esthwaite is a memory of some
charm. We pushed off from the shingle near the
ruined boathouse, and were soon well away. Then
we pulled down to where a streamlet purls into the
lake, and at the mouth of this lines were put over for
perch, as bait for pike. But no tackle for sinking
the baits had been provided, and our flighty thoughts
turn meanwhile to the wealth of water-lilies and
flowering grasses in a bay just below. So long as
open water remained it was easy enough to put the
boat along; but in a tangle of stems, when every pull
at the oars means fouling and pulling plants up by
the roots, it is hard work. The water-lily, with its
heart of bright gold and ivory petals lying just awash
the clear peaty water, is a queen of flowers. Beyond
a profusion of these, tall, straight grasses rise like a
brake over the boat, brown flower tufts crowning
the straight green stems, a background of meadow
tinged white and red and blue with flowers, and a
coppice wood glorious with fox-gloves and wild
Canterbury bells. The faint sweetness rising from
land and water too is a memory to treasure. As we
float idly along there is a variety of bird life to
notice: the king-fisher and the dipper busy on the
shingles and threading the narrow ghylls of the
rivulets: further down we pass a heron, standing
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
poised and still in the shallow. Time was when the
heron was more plentiful in the Lake Country than to-day;
the heronry on the shore of this water, as that
of Rydal, has been tenantless for many a year. A
few pairs still resort to the firs near Whitestock Hall
for breeding, but the only great heronry left is at
Dallam Tower, some leagues away. Yet from the
hills above Esthwaite you may, during winter, watch
the birds rise when evening is falling, and flight away
toward their great haunt and home. The woods
fringing the lower part of the lake are used for the
preserving of the &ldquo;wild&rdquo; duck. The sedges are
haunted with these, and also with coot and waterhens.
Sit still awhile and they will come into sight. Truly
to the patient man nature is free with stories and
secrets. In ten minutes the shyest brood of ducklings
may paddle fearlessly within fifty feet of you, and
often birds are daring enough to dive under and about
your craft. But keep still! The first movement
sends the whole company fluttering into the sedges,
and they will be long in coming out again. The water
is split into a hundred little wakes as the birds dash
along, half flying, half swimming, in terror. In
winter perhaps finer things are to be seen. Attracted
by the plenty of their kind, ducks from northward,
mallard, wigeon, whistlers, come circling down to
Esthwaite: wild geese whistle about the dark waters,
and the clanging of swans resounds during hard
weather from the air above, where in triangular packs
they breast southward, or from the lake, where in
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
wary little groups they feed near the other birds. But
it is a hard winter that brings swans to Esthwaite.
The country about this lake-foot is the only real
haunt of the badger in the Lake Country. A gamekeeper
of my acquaintance says he has often traced
the badger&rsquo;s prints in snow-time, from his domain at
Grisedale to the earth near Esthwaite Lodge. The
badger does not provide regular sport for the dalesmen,
but only a few seasons since a pack of foxhounds ran
a hot scent into a well-known borran here. Terriers
were slipped and &ldquo;found&rdquo; within. As the &ldquo;fox&rdquo;
would not bolt, it was decided to dig him out. The
fight had rapidly shifted far into the ground, so an
attack was delivered on the rear of the piled stones.
Ere long a dalesman, outstretched in the narrow tunnel,
espied a moving of earth ahead. &ldquo;Hold hard!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;this is no fox.&rdquo; Terriers were still at work,
and sounds of their barking with an occasional animal
cry came from within. In five minutes Brother Brock
prepared to bolt, but a sack was ready for his reception,
and as he came with a rush he was caught. Not he
alone, but also one of the terriers who still held on to
his rear.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Our boat is now pulled up the Sawrey shore: to
northward great fells shoulder the sky, and as the
wavelets rumble beneath I think of the boy-life of
Wordsworth. He was educated under the lee of the
old church here, and in this vale began that deep
study and appreciation of nature which shows itself
in his poetry. Wordsworth is at home with nature:
he speaks of birds, of animals of the covert-side, of
flowers and trees, and the ever-changing glory of the
skies and seasons, in far more convincing manner than
of the people he dwelt long years among. In his
school days it was customary to adjourn school of a
Shrove Tuesday that cock-fighting might be practised.
With spurs of sharp steel fastened to their natural
weapons, the selected birds fought in pairs, till one
was cut down and disabled. The sport was cruel,
for the pluck and tenacity of the birds made the
contests more often to the death. The winner of
the &ldquo;main,&rdquo; or rather its owner, was hailed captain
of the school till another champion gained victory.
Wordsworth ever writes with fondness of his boyish
days&mdash;of riding across the fells, of skating on this
mere, of nutting and bird-nesting expeditions to the
unchanging, yet ever-changing woods around. There
is no story of his school days save that told in his
own work; but he admirably portrays the shy lad he
was, his comrades, and his successive schoolmasters.</p>
<p>Here, floating across the water level with ourselves,
is a swan: how graceful its progress, how white the
half-lifted wings as it keeps pace! Calm idyllic beauty
is its charm, and the charm of Esthwaite mere.</p>
<p>One scene characteristic of Lakeland comes before
us at the outskirts of the little town. It is the country
carrier, a lusty, embrowned, genial man, and his large
covered cart within which in picturesque (but safe)
confusion are the parcels from a larger town to our
vale. Storm or calm, rain, shine, or snow, so regular
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
that events are timed by his appearances, passes the
carrier along the roads of this land where are no
railways. An old farmer, selling some sheep to a
dealer, asked when he would take away his purchase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it do if I come about the seventh of next
month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh aye,&rdquo; but the old man looked puzzled. After
the dealer had taken his leave, a reflective voice
sounded from the ingle-nook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo; seventh o&rsquo; next month! That&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and for
awhile the old farmer counted on his fingers, but
without satisfaction to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be t&rsquo; Tuesday after t&rsquo; carrier comes, father,&rdquo;
announced a matron who was washing dishes at the
far end of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; responded the old man promptly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll
be three weeks to-morn; t&rsquo; sheep&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not an extraordinary thing to hear in our
dales where the list of &ldquo;inevitables&rdquo; is: Rent-day,
Candlemas (February 2nd, when all accounts are
rendered), <i>and</i> t&rsquo; Carrier.</p>
<p>The carrier&rsquo;s life is an arduous one, yet we have
whole families who succeed one another in it without
a break. Our oldest &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; family is to be traced
in manor-rolls far into the pack-horse days. The
halting of the railway on the confines of Lakeland
has preserved, and indeed given impetus to, his craft.
He is a necessity to dales-life, but now he is perhaps
doomed to totally disappear. The new traffic companies
are hoping to send their motors, humming
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
and throbbing, with loads of parcels into the villages
and over the passes. As a rule our carrier is a genial
soul&mdash;he knows the gossip of a hundred miles of
road. &ldquo;We can neither stir dish nor spoon,&rdquo; complain
the daleswomen (who are keenest to hear his news
and give notes of their neighbours), &ldquo;wi&rsquo;out the
carrier hearin&rsquo; on it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small"><i>CONISTON WATER</i></span></h2>
<p>On a sultry afternoon, the wanderer over High
Cross from Hawkshead suddenly sees a gulf
beneath, a delectable vision of waters, the ancient
Thurston mere; a lake of shining silver, chased with
darker lines and patches as faint catspaws play here
and there, with calm pools irradiating the sunlight
like clusters of diamonds, the glow fining down to a
distant wisp of blue threading between hills and woods.
The setting is lovely as the gem: fertile, swelling
farmlands, with here and there a white-walled home
peering through its curtain of sycamore, the venerable
grey church behind its yews, and the village straggling
around its God&rsquo;s acre. Often so ethereal seems the
beauty and repose that one fears that tree-shaded bays,
white beaches, and spreading reaches dotted with a
shimmering sail or two, will yet dissolve in the
disappointment of a mirage. For the road one walks
is a dusty ribbon over a parched moor, the grouse
cluck drowsily in the heather, the rabbits lop lazily
into the furze&mdash;the larks alone sing briskly, for they
have climbed to fuller life in the highest heavens,
far from the slumbrous world around us; the
mountains afar off swim in haze, their scarry sides
uncertain seem, but down there is the fruitful valley
of the lake, with dancing rills, fields of green corn,
and its flowery meadows ready for the mower. Such
is the delightful picture unrolled as a hundred yards
are passed, then a corner of the hills shuts it from
view.</p>

<p class="caption">DAWN, CONISTON</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Coniston, the third longest of our Lakes, is perhaps
the one most intimately associated with our earliest
civilisations. On its placid bosom the Britons plied
their coracles; they were keen anglers, and built their
settlements near the lake-shore. Next came the Roman
legions, to whose credit is placed by some the presence
in Lakeland of that toothsome fish, the char. And after
them, Norsemen raiding from the seaboard for harvests
denied to their semi-frozen home-land, yet after
awhile remaining permanent settlers on the soil. They
built their boats of timbers from the forests around,
and on Peel Island one erected a house, the foundations
of which have recently been determined by an antiquarian.
After the Norseman, the Saxon. And the
char were taken up the fells to dark Gateswater, over
which the golden eagle screamed and round which
roved bear and wolf. The Normans after a couple of
centuries of strife found the land comfortable to dwell
in, but no baron ousted the native from his hearth.
And the char had been carried further, over the pass
beyond the haunt of the wild eagles to where the
seafowl scream&mdash;lonely Seathwaite tarn. With the
Norman came the forest laws and rights to fish the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
lake. Nets were reserved to the lord of Coningstone,
and the Le Flemings became a mighty power in the
dale. The monks of Furness Abbey, not many miles
distant, afterwards obtained great privileges here&mdash;a
relic of their times is to be found in the shore woods.
Down among the roots of the trees, deep beneath
accumulations of leaf-soil, are red metal stains and
nodules of iron. Trees were converted into charcoal
by the industrious monks, and iron ore brought here
to be smelted. A thriving trade was this long after
it had reverted to the great families, whom it enabled
to prosper during dark times. The ore was conveyed
by the lake to the neighbourhood of the &ldquo;bloomery,&rdquo;
and again was so carried to the waiting panniered
ponies. Great rafts of forest trees also floated down
with the slow current. All this while Coniston Water
had been in unsullied purity. But a century ago copper
was found among the fells and mines opened. Refuse
ran down in muddy streams, tainting the lake from
head to foot. Many fish died, for the shingles on
which they had previously spawned were fouled, and,
though ripe with ova, they could not perpetuate their
kind. The damage was not completed in a season,
but in thirty years, just as English law began to protect
the finny denizens, the lake had been robbed of
a great proportion of its fish. Twenty years more
the mines continued to send down poisonous offal.
Then the copper veins gave out, pollution ceased,
and the fishery gradually improved. A few years
ago it was gravely propounded as a fact that the
lack of size in the angler&rsquo;s spoils here was due
entirely to the overcrowding of the water by the
trout and perch! It is not many places where such
an accusation can be brought forward. A large
number of visitors annually come for the angling alone;
and as they are seen year after year, no doubt they
find it worth while from the sporting as well as the
scenic point of view.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The lake-head is bounded by a mass of mountains
of which the Old Man is the chief. On the east of the
water too the hills are lofty, their lowest slopes a mass
of coppice and larches, their upper braes wild and
desolate. It seems odd to look down from these
upland farms, where everything is sterile, on the soft,
rich-looking lands of the lake-side.</p>
<p>Coniston Water is hardly less famous for the people
who have lived on its shores than is Windermere
or even Grasmere. To the challenge of Wordsworth
and Coleridge and De Quincey, of Christopher North,
Hemans and Arnold, it can reply with Tennyson,
Linton, and, greatest and nearest of all, John Ruskin.
If Grasmere reveres the ashes of Wordsworth, Coniston
holds in no less esteem those of Ruskin&mdash;and the
memory of the great is so much the more living.
Every one almost in Coniston remembers Professor
Ruskin, but few folks can recall Wordsworth.
However, my concern is less with rival celebrities than
with the lake and its natural surroundings.</p>
<p>To know Coniston Water well is to be convinced
that one&rsquo;s pen cannot describe it. The greatest master
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
of English descriptive prose, John Ruskin, after years
of residence, left the task undone. Duty, however,
dictates that some attempt must be made, and I cannot
conceive anything more likely to give a fair idea of
the lake and its surroundings than notes on a long
summer day spent on its waters.</p>
<p>We breakfasted by candlelight&mdash;one of our party
was a keen angler and had persuaded us to rising before
the midsummer sun. Outside the cottage the air came
cool and fresh, laden with the fragrance of the morning&mdash;honeysuckles
over our porch and new mown hay, wild
roses of the hedgerows and sweet flowers of our garden,
larch woods and white-wreathed fields. The faint light
just shows a sea of mist overhanging the lake, shows
patches of cloud wandering among delicate grey-blue
crag and mountain. Now we near the lakeside: the
deep blue sky becomes dimmed by trailers of vapour.
The boat engaged by the angler overnight is here; but,
as he speaks of remaining hours in his almost
motionless craft, and that is not to our taste, we select
another, opening, after much labour, a link in the
mooring chain and setting it free. The view when
first we are afloat is curious: a bank of mist overhangs
the lake; we can see the lower meadows around, but
the mountains are invisible. Soon, however, we find
the mist sweeping away in the dawn-breeze.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Day is at hand, the dark hour of the morning watch
is ending. One by one the stars fade away: a dark
shadow passes up the sky from eastward, and the
horizon there is being fringed with kindlier light.
A cloud floating high above flushes from pearly grey
to pink at its edges, to purple in its densest plume,
and, as it floats nearer the day, to crimson, to red,
and to glistening gold. And now we rest on the
oars to watch the coming of the sun to the mountain
tops. The fuller light has revealed a glorious scene:
the horizon is a rugged sea of summits, lands of
rocky steeps with torrents gushing down&mdash;Helvellyn
and Seat Sandal, the Pikes and Fairfield, with,
nearer at hand, Wetherlam, the Carrs, and Old
Man himself. Shortly the coming sunshine touches
one after another of these giants: Fairfield&rsquo;s huge
gashes where the foxes dwell secure are picked
out in gloom and light before day bends to
awake the Old Man from his rest. It is interesting
to watch the band of sunshine gradually descend
his stony, riven flanks. At first only the cairn has
the glow; then shortly, a hundred feet below, shadow
divides from light. So day breaks among the mountains.
Purple shadows still remain in the hollows,
the dark green of woodlands is softly dusked: on
Coniston Water it is light, though the sun&rsquo;s rays still
linger aloft. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; grunts the angler at this
juncture&mdash;the scene to him is beauteous, no doubt,
but for his art most valuable minutes are wasting
away. We heed him not, and shortly his oars rattle
as he pulls for the bay in which the trout should
be on the feed. Awhile we feast our eyes on sunlit
mountains and shadowy glens, then our oars are plied
to take us further down the lake. Quite close to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
shore is the Old Hall, once the home of the great
Le Fleming family, but now merely a picturesque
farmhouse. To Sir Daniel of that family was due the
peaceful succession in the three north-western counties
of Charles II. after the Interregnum. In Oliver&rsquo;s day
his house at Rydal was almost demolished by soldiers
seeking a hidden treasure. To me Sir Daniel is more
interesting as the first man to attempt to solve the
life-history of the char of our lakes. In few particulars
only are we able to improve his observations to-day.
The char is the most mysterious as it is the most
beautiful of British fishes. Though for three hundred
years &ldquo;silver&rdquo; and &ldquo;gilt&rdquo; char have been noted, no
close observer will say there are two varieties of the
fish. Sir Daniel suggested that the two divisions
spawn at different periods&mdash;November and February
respectively&mdash;but the information then and now hardly
justified the idea. During the midsummer months
char are bottom feeders; in April and early May, and
again towards the close of the fishing season, they
occasionally come near the surface, and odd captures
are made with the fly. Char average about nine inches
in length and three-quarters of a pound in weight. A
two-pound char is a great event among the lakemen.
Potted char is quite a Lakeland delicacy, and commands
high prices. In former times each inn had its stew
into which the fish netted or plumbed were placed
till a demand for them came along. West, touring over
a century ago, mentions particularly the stews at
Waterhead Inn, Coniston, and the Ferry, Windermere,
as holding great numbers of char. Char pie was once
a favourite dish too; in the Le Fleming house-keeping
accounts, dating back nearly three hundred years,
mentions are made of the large number of fish so
used up. Char pie of those days is said to have
been so full of spices that the flavour of the fish was
neutralised out of existence. In the papers preserved
at Holker Hall, a noble duke orders fish for a char
pie to be sent to London without loss of time&mdash;in
December, when the char would be spawning and far
from toothsome!</p>

<p>Now the light is falling in a wider riband; it
has touched the top of Yewdale crags, the scarred
Mines valley is brimming with radiance. How uneven
that line where shadow meets sunshine! Still lower
bends the light; it is now only minutes before the
lake will be flooded in glory. The heights round
Torver are in the realm of sunshine, but the larches
of Brantwood side are green and unkindled. Not
a breath of air disturbs the flat calm. Over the
eastern hills the great round sun rolls into sight.
Everything is transformed. The subdued grey light is
expelled by shimmering gold, green hills and fields
alike are suffused with a living blaze. A boat pulled
out from the pier near the Old Hall is followed by
a wake of pale gold, the oars drip diamonds, the
curl of parting waters is like a crystal-crowned sapphire.</p>
<p>To see Coniston Water by broad daylight nothing
is better than Felix Hammel&rsquo;s handsome craft, though
the commander will cheerfully admit that we, in our
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
pulling boat, had the best of it at dawn. The
<i>Gondola&rsquo;s</i> landing-stage is in the shade of some
mighty oaks, an old cottage astride a shallow waiting-room
with a jetty running out a few yards into the
lake. The craft is of strange shape; at the stern,
where the engines are placed, the draught is a yard
and a half, but at bow&mdash;&ldquo;There are few places on
Coniston Lake,&rdquo; says Mr. Hammel, &ldquo;where I could
not put the prow into the green fields while the
stern was in deep water,&rdquo; which, incidentally, shows
the paucity of shallows. Mr. Hammel is fond of
the engines which drive his taper-keeled craft along.
&ldquo;Fourteen horse-power, yet they drive the boat
through the wildest gales betwixt April and September.
I have sailed here for twenty-five years, and we
have lost time but once. That was the wildest gale
that ever smote this water. It blew from sou&rsquo;-west,
and there was a pretty lively water going. Not big
rollers, but nasty short things that broke and shook
themselves out into a cross-sea that would have made
a pulling boat a mighty risky thing to be in. But
the <i>Gondola</i> ran within five minutes of normal&mdash;the
five and a half miles from here to Lake Bank
we reckon to do in thirty-five minutes. That wild
day it took forty. Only two days in my experience
has the steamer not run. During the wet summer
of 1903 the lake was so full that for two days the
landing-stage was under water, and never a passenger
got within two hundred yards of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you did a bit of fishing out of your
windows those two days,&rdquo; I commented. Mr. Hammel
is an angler&mdash;as keen as ever.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">

<p class="caption">MOONLIGHT AND LAMPLIGHT, CONISTON</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly out of the windows, though of course I
did do a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the hands of the clock nearly point
to starting-time; passengers are rapidly coming on
board, and to hurry up laggards Mr. Hammel sends
a flute-like note booming and swelling from the syren.
Now there is a quiet rumble as the engines start,
a purling of water beneath the stern, and the
<i>Gondola</i> backs out into the lake. Tent Lodge,
where Tennyson once dwelt, is almost opposite&mdash;a
square sturdy house standing on a narrow green bank
just above the water. The little landing-stage looks
decidedly picturesque now; our craft pauses as though
regretting to leave so happy a scene, then again the
thrumming begins and we are swung round toward
the foot of the lake. Far away two green banks
contract till the water seems to end: Fir Island narrows
the curving lake there. Brantwood is a pretty house
beneath the fell, the views from its windows are
splendid. Here Ruskin came to spend his latter days,
in a house which had been occupied by Linton, the
famous wood-engraver. The homelikeness of Brantwood
is to me its chief charm: once a dweller in it,
no mortal can, I should think, be so dead to natural
beauties as not often to picture it, when far away,
in memory&rsquo;s freshest pigments. The eyes of all on
board are turned to Brantwood&mdash;Mr. Hammel is speaking
of it to a bevy of interested young ladies, the other
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
lakemen are pointing it out to those near them; but,
seated on the knife-like ridge of iron where his stokehole
joins the deck, the engineer is looking intently
at the greasy jacket of his boiler! Instantly his posture
captures my attention. What meant that strange
position? Were we in danger of an explosion? The
engineer&rsquo;s back was eloquent of intent inspection, even
of alertness. Nothing happened, however, and as none
of the lakemen seemed apprehensive I did not allow
that rapt gaze to spoil my pleasure further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brantwood?&rdquo; says Mr. Hammel, &ldquo;and Ruskin?
Well, of course I knew the Professor well. He
wasn&rsquo;t a man to laugh and talk much, though. For
five-and-twenty years I have done odd repairs to
Mr. Severn&rsquo;s yacht at Brantwood, and I often met
the old gentleman thereabouts. Mr. Ruskin did not
like scrow [upset], I remember, and every year the
family used to go down to Lake Bank Hotel till spring
cleaning was over. Mr. Ruskin went with them, of
course. Mr. Severn used to hire the <i>Gondola</i>, and we
ran in to the landing-stage to take servants and luggage
on board. Now you know Mr. Ruskin didn&rsquo;t like
our boat at all&mdash;I believe he used to write a bit bitter
about it; but I remember once (it was in the seventies)
when we drew it to the stage, that Mr. Ruskin
stood there with Mrs. Severn and the family. I was
surprised and some pleased, I can tell you, when <i>he</i>
came on board. He went all over the boat, into
every corner while we were steaming down, looked at
the engines a long while and asked a lot of sharp
questions about them&mdash;he knew a fair bit about
machinery in spite of his old-fashioned ways and ideas.
Then when we were nearing Lake Bank he came out
of the saloon there, and as he passed me, said with
a nice smile, &lsquo;I <i>may</i> like steam after all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">AN OLD INN KITCHEN, CONISTON</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember any others of the big men who
lived about here,&rdquo; I ask my friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes: there was Mr. Tennyson lived across at
Tent Lodge awhile, and in the seventies we had Carlyle
here at the Waterhead Hotel two or three weeks. He
used to have the steamer nearly every morning for
a cruise around. He was a pleasant man to do
with, but quiet. They used to say to me that
Carlyle never laughed, and Mr. Ruskin but rarely,
but I know different. One evening when Carlyle
was here, I was across at Brantwood doing some
repair to Mr. Severn&rsquo;s yacht that was drawn up on
the slip. While I was working away, down from
the house came Mr. Ruskin and Carlyle and sat
down on a pile of rough stones beside the slip. I
didn&rsquo;t take much heed of what they were talking
about, for I was thrang [busy]; but I remember well
that I was surprised to hear a big burst of laughing.
I looked up&mdash;it was Mr. Ruskin, and before my
eyes were fairly clapt on him Carlyle roared out
quite as long and loud as he. Then they sat there
full a quarter of an hour, talking quite merry, and
every now and then there was a crack of laughing
as made your heart feel glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Mr. Hammel steps away and takes charge
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
of the wheel of the steamer. There is little need
of fine steering, for the water is deep and free from
reefs.</p>
<p>We move along the crowded promenade deck to
get a better view of the grand mountains clustering
around. Like a sheet of blue the water stretches
far away to meet the multi-shaded greens beneath
High Cross. Yewdale crags are prominent, but the
soaring ridges culminating in Old Man&rsquo;s pointed
top fill the eye most. Now the eastern shore is
crowded with regiments of larches, growing where
once the old monks burnt charcoal for their bloomeries
by the beckside. On the right is Torver Common
where never a wall is to be seen, and the lake-shore
is fringed with rocks. Fir Island, a mass of Scotch
firs or stone pines, anchored to a narrow rib of
rock, has been passed, and now seems like a promontory
of green. The woods on the mainland look
delightful in this pleasant air, but the stiff lines of
their planting is rather an eyesore. The coppice
woods next succeed, in wide acres climbing to the
skyline. These are allowed to grow fifteen years,
then, when the saplings are about six inches thick,
all are felled. The best wood is sent down to the
mines to use as props; the other portions, after being
peeled (for even in these days of chemical tanning
bark of ash and oak and sycamore is still put on the
market), are placed in neat circular piles in the
centre of which a fire is laid. Then by a covering
of wet turf the air is excluded. The fire has been
sufficiently kindled not to be put out by the short
supply of air, and it smoulders away for weeks.
Much charcoal burning is done in the winter, and
a pleasant scene it is to find on a snow-clad day
lines of smoke rising from the barrenness where
once was woodland, men moving round the conical
patches from which internal heat has melted the white
covering, the rough huts, the incipient flicker which
has to be immediately quenched else the whole oven
of charcoal be spoiled, the thinning smoke which
threatens a dead fire there, to which the woodmen
hasten to encourage the hidden blaze.</p>

<p class="caption">THE SHEPHERD, YEWDALE, CONISTON</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Peel Island, alluded to before, is the place when
in the time of the Sagas a Norseman dwelt, and a
daring man he was to live on so low a rib of rock.
In a wild gale the water, lashing its rocky sides, will
throw spray right over it. In relief the islet is mitred;
two rock ledges face the lake, leaving between a
grassy depression some feet in depth. Our old
Norseman built walls across this gap, then with poles
and twigs from the shore-woods made a roof, and
thereby obtained a home sufficient in its humble way
to provide shelter in the wildest weather. In spring
the glen of the islet is a mass of blue&mdash;with wild
hyacinths. The lake is now becoming riverine in
character, its banks are nearing rapidly, a picnic party
seated on the rock-set shore wave and call merrily
to the passing craft. The water is still as a pond,
the reflections only broken in the wake of the
passing steamer. And thus we come to Lake Bank,
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the end of the lake for steamer purposes, and the
point to which coaches drive from Greenodd and
Ulverston. It is a change for a good walker to get
ashore here, and by the Brantwood shore return&mdash;a
walk of some eight miles.</p>
<p>At first the road leads down by the rushing Crake,
then crosses. The traveller passes through tall-hedged
lanes, past old-world farms nestling against sheering
hillsides. Once there is a beautiful glimpse&mdash;a vista
of lake, Fir Island in foreground, and far away the
rising fells. Just as the walker feels that Brantwood
must be at hand, the woods open a little; here is a
point jutting out into the lake to which he can easily
pass, a shelf of shingle, overgrown with wych elms
and sallows, but from it is a marvellous view. Not
too far for detail to be dimmed is Coniston Hall, the
church and the village, Mines valley and Yewdale crags,
Old Man, Wetherlam and a number of giant hills.
In autumn particularly the play of light and shade
among the woodlands is glorious. The road passes
within a few yards of Brantwood. If the wanderer
has time to spare let him leave the road by one of
the paths he sees up the hillside. There is little
danger of any one complaining of trespass if you should
light upon a worn path that is not public. Rising
some two hundred feet up you are above coppice
woods, and come among the heather, enjoying an
excellent view of the lake and its surroundings. How
peaceful such a place at sunset! Once I watched
the sun set in a haze of blood red: the lake turned
like frozen gore beneath my eyes, the hillsides mantled
in crimson, the outstanding spurs of rock were wreathed
in fire, a purple shadow gradually gathered in the
hollows. Then, through a ravishing succession of
tints, the scene melted away till I was looking down
on a lake with moonlight shimmering on it, edged
by blue, rocky mountains.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="722" />
<p class="caption">STEPPING-STONES, SEATHWAITE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>One scene more and I have finished. It is of
mid-winter&mdash;and night. Day was dying ere we left
the village; with a parting glish at the snow-covered
church tower, the sun left the lower glen. Now the
hills were pointed with fire; from the lake a blue
vapour rose as the air chilled, to join the helm of
feathery smoke gradually spreading from the village.
The glen was snowbound indeed; from hedges and
plantations came the rustle of slipping snow; a partial
thaw after the snowfall passed gave us the roads
fairly clear. There were many slippery places, but
to the careful and robust there was pleasure in the
prospect of a walk. Large flocks of sheep are crowded
into the fields lying near the farms we pass; there
a weary shepherd is still at work. On the higher
farms the shelter of the plantations will have been
courted; down here a huge rib of rock lies athwart
the wind, and the fields have been but little swept by
the storm. Almost the most arduous of a shepherd&rsquo;s
trials is after a long snowstorm. His flock have
to be mustered; if the snow has drifted at all a band
of ewes are sure to be beneath it, and these have to
be got out. Then comes the problem of hand-feeding
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
perhaps a thousand. Hay and roots may be brought
by sleigh, but the labour of distribution is great. The
soft snow clings so tenaciously to the grass beneath
that to walk a hundred yards in the fields is too hard
work for any pleasure-seeker. The sheep are nosing
down to the hidden grass: even in the hardest weather
they forage well for themselves, though the gap
between &ldquo;feed&rdquo; and &ldquo;appetite&rdquo; is often very wide.
The lake looks blue and cold under its veil of soft
vapour; a skin of ice is forming. There is a loud
crack and a rattling echo passes along the frozen
surface. Eerie it is so to hear the ice &ldquo;stretching&rdquo;:
the frostier the night the louder and more frequent
the reports. (In 1895 I was on Windermere after
dark&mdash;it was a moonless night&mdash;and the loud and long
continued roars which spread about the ice were
almost alarming.) Soon we are in the byroad for
Tarn Hows. The trees meet overhead, and if it
were not for the white flashes of snow between them
the way would be bad to find. The road is slippery,
and time and again we have to leave the metalled part
for the snow-banks to get on at all. The sounds
heard in the woods on a frosty night are interesting.
A faint rustle in the undergrowth as a small bird hops
from one twig to another, a faint rumble and a sissing
of snow as a rabbit bolts away, the thud of falling
pieces of snow from the branches, the crackling of
twigs as the frost nips harder, the blundering rush
of a large bird through the curtain of branches,
followed by a mimic snowstorm of dislodged particles;
from darksome glades, the melancholy hoot of the
wood owl and the shriekings of the barn owl, then
from far away floats the chime proclaiming the hour,
the cadence dying in sweet confusion over the tapering
larches.</p>

<p class="caption">WINTER SUNSHINE, CONISTON</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>So far the way has been steep and the footing
uncertain; now, however, we rise above the woods
to the open hillside. The angle of ascent is less
difficult and the snow firm to the tread. Our path
forms a terrace above Yewdale. Beneath is a glen
cumbered with snow; above, a sky liberally dusted with
stars large and small, the gentle light from which
is sufficient to kindle the jewels on the frosted snow.
The air is chill, but our blood is too warm for us to
be more than barely conscious of it. From a corner
of the track we have an excellent view backward.
The lake is still hidden in its curtain of mist, the dark
woods of Brantwood side climb sharply into the white
desolations. Coniston Old Man over the way&mdash;how
truly near it looks!&mdash;is gilded by a new light;
the moon is rising and the light spreads over summit
and upper snowfield, over crag and bield and lower
slack of white, finally touching with crystal the fields
and houses in the deep dingles around. From one
point we look over a wilderness of snow to other
dales, but the expected mountain heads are hidden in
pearly cloud. The tarn is covered with ice, and some
time we spend sliding. Then to return, but first of
all notice that grey moving blotch on the shoulder
of Wetherlam. The glasses show a family of wild
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
goats. Villagers of Coniston tell of a herd of over
thirty observed not many seasons ago, while groups
of over a dozen occasionally tempt the keen gunster
out on to the chilly wastes.</p>
<p>The goats, I am told, were introduced about a
century ago in order to prevent fell-sheep frequenting
dangerous cliffs&mdash;for a goat is safe where a sheep
will turn giddy, and, falling, be dashed to pieces. By
nature the sheep is divided from the goat, and will
not browse the same pasture. For long it was a
custom of the quarrymen of Tilberthwaite to assemble
on Good Friday morning, and attempt to hunt the
goats haunting the fell near by. But though a kid
or so, weaker than the rest, might be taken, I never
heard that much success accompanied these chases.
The goats from Coniston fells wander in search of
toothsome grass to beyond the Duddon, and there
is record of an exciting hunt among the rocks of
Wallabarrow for a wandering goat. In winter only do
these animals approach civilisation; their usual haunts
are the crags above sequestered glens. The snow
crunches under our feet, and we speedily come down
to where we again catch view of Coniston Water. Now
it is clear of mist, the whitened fields, blotched with
woods, limned with hedges, are in sharp contrast to
the grey ice, and to the glittering unfrozen water in
mid-lake. A glory almost approaching that of day
spreads over the scene: the queen of the heavens is
indeed &ldquo;walking in brightness&rdquo; here.</p>

<br /><span class="small"><i>THE MOODS OF WASTWATER</i></span></h2>
<p>I never think of Wastwater without recalling
some exciting hours&mdash;Wastwater surrounded by
crag-set mountains and wide bouldery moorlands where
foxes rule wild and strong. Under Tommie Dobson,
that genius among fell-land huntsmen, a pack of wiry
hounds has been raised in the bordering dales. In
pursuit ruthless, untiring, determined; a chase from
dawn to night, over country bristling with difficulties, is
no unusual thing to them. Screes, miles of frittering
mountain rampart, Yewbarrow, ridged like a Napoleon&rsquo;s
hat, Scawfells, impending over great piles of fragments,
Gable; about these are benks and earths and borrans
innumerable. Never a season do they fail the hunt;
never do they fail for redskins to plunder flock and
poultry roost. Then the wilds to Ennerdale&mdash;I had
climbed the slope of Gable before the meet at dawn
on a spring day, the crisp air became full of music&mdash;what
finer sounds than those from a foxhound&rsquo;s
throat!&mdash;the turf was springy and dry, the sky flecked
with high-sailing clouds. To climb the rocky terraces
was delightful; to hunt&mdash;the exhilaration needs experience,
it is beyond my words to describe. No pink
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
coat was in the knot of men below; and a follower on
horseback is seldom seen at a meet by Wastwater.
Hounds unkennelled as they left the short lane from
the inn, and soon above the babble of eager questers
rose the clear peal of a true find. To one line
gathered the pack, and away! Not often does Reynard
give so good a chance. Over the tall drystone walls
surged the hounds, at first in a compact bunch, then,
as pace began to tell, dribbling out into a line. Out
of the fields, and into the intakes of Mosedale; and
ever higher rose the note of the chase, ever smarter
the gliding forward of the clan. A check! From
Gable&rsquo;s lofty flank I saw hounds halt at a dark grey
patch of stones, circle it almost in silence. Reynard
has gone aground; the huntsmen and the fleeter
followers come up. The scent drew the pack in and
out, over wall and beck, through dead bracken and
crackling heather, three or four good miles, but the
huntsman, judging the true route, reached the borran
in less than a mile. The hounds called away, terriers
are put &ldquo;in&rdquo; and possibly will have Reynard out ere
long. Nowhere but in the fells are terriers really
used after foxes&mdash;nowhere else, the dalesmen proudly
say, are dogs capable of doing such work. After a
considerable delay two white dots stray out on to
the dark grey stones&mdash;Reynard has been killed in the
dark recesses.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="691" />
<p class="caption">A FELL FOX-HUNT, HEAD OF ESKDALE AND SCAWFELL</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The sun is now high, the cloud flecks are gone,
the air has become warm. Long ago foxes ceased
to be afoot, and hours of careful work by huntsman
and hounds may be necessary to find another fair
scent. But even the pattern of all wiliness, like
the human votaries at his shrine, sometimes overreaches
himself. After a tedious march it is refreshing
to hear hounds speak to a piping line. Reynard, lying
out in a pile of boulders, has heard the coming pack.
He steals away&mdash;too late, for a keen-sighted dalesman
has viewed him away. Ten minutes of frenzied rushing,
and the fox is reached. Ruby in the van seizes him,
and over go both at the impact. The hound, aged but
plucky, loses his grip and Reynard is free again; down
the scree, in the very access of terror, the redskin flies,
but with a couple of bounds Chorister has him fast.
The iron jaws crunch into the fox&rsquo;s spine, and though
together they roll near twenty yards the grip never
falters. There is no &ldquo;worry&rdquo; at the death; the
hounds, now that their enemy is dead, take little further
notice of him. Ofttimes the death is compassed a
mile away from the nearest follower, but occasionally
a fair number view the finish. And to do this you
may have to come pell mell down some rotten &ldquo;rake.&rdquo;
We saw hounds stream over a patch of snow on a
near-by hill: a dalesman pointed out Reynard dead
beat a hundred yards in front. &ldquo;The Gate,&rdquo; called
some one, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s going down?&rdquo; Six of us rushed
for the head of that precipitous scree-shoot. The
angle of descent was terrible, but, hunting mad,
we leapt and slid, stumbled and jolted down. A
thousand feet plumb drop, with a hail of loose
stones roaring behind us. The rake-foot was narrow,
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
between perpendicular rocks, and in single file we
raced down. No one tried to halt; if it were thought
of, the gathering pelt of stones decided in favour
of forward. Shades of Silver Howe! In the madness
of the guide-race you never saw the like of this.
But after five minutes of real, tearing life&mdash;oh! it&rsquo;s
good to have lived through such a time!&mdash;we were
running down the smoother grass. The hounds were
probably quite close by&mdash;running mute for the death&mdash;and
across the roaring, flooded beck within a score
yards came the fox. We halted in silence&mdash;back up,
tongue lolling, moving stiffly and with evident pain,
he was the scourge of the fells, but a respected foe
at that. Thrice had he been chased far, now came
for him the end. Two outstripping hounds shot
across a cove which was bank-high in snow, leapt at
him, and all was over.</p>
<p>Wastwater, its bed hewn and filled by Almighty
power in the beginning to contrast the silvern temporalities
of a level mere with the solid, silent, rugged
eternities of rock around. There is always some
pleasure to the hale of body and mind in climbing
from Wastwater, whether by pony-track, mountain-path,
or dangerous puzzle route up the cliffs. In
early October I had to cross to Wastwater from
Keswick. In the golden glory of afternoon we passed
up Borrowdale. One side the glen sloomed in dying
bronze of bracken, the other was grey with nude
birches below, chocolate with heather above. We left
the main road and passed into the desolate mountain
land. As the sun declined, clouds, at first mackerel
but now dull and heavy with rain and night, floated
majestically from behind the western mountains. Shortly
in a low cloud cornice Gable&rsquo;s head was buried, and
billow after billow of mist possessed the higher ground:
at Rosthwaite the glow of day, here the portents of
night and foul weather. &ldquo;Fraternal Three&rdquo; and the
old wad-mine took but a moment&rsquo;s attention, then
away, up the narrow dell.</p>

<p class="caption">WASTWATER, FROM STRANDS</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Night fast closed round. Our last look back barely
showed the curve of Borrowdale. Gillercombe, scored
by tremendous ravines, presided over a scene of almost
indescribable wildness. The wind roared and boomed
above, the steady drift of fine rain was in our faces.
Hoarsely down its rugged bed the beck sang in
accord. Grey light and dashing water, with gloom
intense above and a rain-sodden world below, our
path uncertain, picked out by boulders. Bogs of
sphagnum, sponged a foot high with water, runnels
where in summer are hollows filled with wee splinters,
the rills all shouting becks, and the becks flooding
torrents. Our boots full of water, wet to the thigh,
we still squelched on. In a while we came to a
narrow footbridge, and crossed the chief torrent.
&ldquo;Where is the path?&rdquo; I knew not, nor cared.
Swinging bogs were all about; a grisly light crept
through the clouds in front: that showed the pass-head,
and was my guide. Now, we stood within
twenty yards of Stye Head Tarn&mdash;what a scene!
Half invisible, a patch of wind-spurned waters, dark
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
mountains sweeping upward, cloven by black ghylls,
whitish beards of cloud stealthily moving along and
hiding the higher ground in ghostly embrace. The
sounds&mdash;the tongues of many waters, and the night
wind weirding among crags and crannies. Ten minutes
more, our path in a long curve swept down the rock-shelves
toward the dale. What a gulf of gloom, the
waterfalls roaring and possessing the night! Take
care, take care, the way is full of stumbling-blocks,
of pitfalls; to the right is steep rock, to the left a
precipice. Over it&mdash;crane your neck and see if foothold
is visible beneath. Such is Stye Head Pass

<p>We reach the scree where the route is safer, but
at the zig-zags more than once overshoot the path.
The clouds apparently are densest near the mountains,
for beyond the rock-girt valley some brighter clouds
render darkness almost visible. There is a dream
of a grey Wastwater, a mirage of something not
chaos beyond. A spark of light shows where the
hotel lies, but it is far away. Some twenty minutes
from the pass-head we find grass beneath our feet.
Looking backward, there is a walpurgis of grey
shadow and black night. Now the path is easier
and we walk more rapidly, though frequently stumbles
remind us that the path is far from smooth. The
light&mdash;from hospitable windows&mdash;is nearing perceptibly.
Now, in front, is a darker mass&mdash;the yew-trees crowding
round a tiny House of God, shielding it by their
tough green limbs from the storms. We were walking
quietly in the narrow lane thinking of the gloom
on all things made, when a white shadow beyond
that of the dale-church arrested us. What is it?
Memory hasted back a week to that most terrible
disaster in the annals of Lakeland rock-climbing&mdash;the
accident on the Scawfell Pillar. Four fine young men
were killed, and three are laid here. A heap of
white flowers, like a pall of mountain snow, masks
the grave. Sadly impressive is the scene; the white
wilting flowers represent fitly the brief human span
of life&mdash;to-day we are, to-morrow we are not, thus is
the will of God: the dense green yew-trees symbolise
death, the time-long end of man. But look higher, I
felt&mdash;around. &ldquo;O death, where is thy sting?&rdquo; for,
though the mists of night bewilder, great rock-ribs
are rising upward, higher, ever higher, till earth and
heaven meet. And the yew of death will moulder
by the kirkgarth, but the mountains must stand fast
to prove eternity&mdash;immeasurable, infinite.</p>
<p>Wastwater, its shores treeless and forlorn, its waters
rippling against their shingly bays, with mountains
beyond and around, curtains of rock and ribbons of
scree. In the cool days of spring the mountains are
delightful, but sometimes there is a sudden revulsion
to winter. A shade sweeps from nor&rsquo;east, and behold
a squall plastering all with snow, a gale shrieking
around, and the temperature tumbling to zero. Such
mischances apart, the bracing air makes a new
creature of one after the fogs of winter, and you simply
stroll up the ascents. So much has been written of
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
the mountain-climbing around Wastwater that to
infuse romance, to say any new thing, is difficult.
Steep ghylls there are to ascend, loose bands of scree
to pass, bogs varying in depth according to weather.
Here a rushing rivulet to ford, there, winding beneath
crazy rock fragments, the path hangs on the brink
of a deep ravine; collar work up five hundred feet
of slippery grass, and splendid poising exercise over
beds of boulders. When winter holds sway and a
white garb hides the bloom of meadows and hillsides,
Wastwater is a very home of loneliness. Its surface is
no home for the wildfowl from northward: a wastewater
it is to them and not worth a minute of the
foody, oozy sands of Irt and Esk, seven miles away.
Loneliness and silence. When the babel of the flock
in the intakes ceases to the ear, the absence of all sound
will depress the liveliest soul. The air, chill and
cutting, goes soundlessly by; the lake broods in leaden,
stirless gloom. There is no sound of tinkling rivulets;
the raven&rsquo;s croak, the curlew&rsquo;s wild shriek, are no
longer heard; the plover, the heron, and the birds
of the hedgerow have flown to less sombre regions.
When the stars are mirrored in the steely blue water
and the moon throws shafts of glory across the
mountain barrier, the silence is more crushing. One
side the dale is in shadow; frost spangles give to
the other an ethereal, unreal illume. Gable and the
Scawfells are snowbound where on ledge and scree
snow can lie; the rocks, through which, from the
mountain&rsquo;s heart, hidden springs are driven, are
sheathed with ice. Day after day, the deadness of
living nature seems to increase; day after day, the
unknowable mysteries of the mountains seem to
deepen. The loudest voice seems hushed; the most
fervid imagination is consciously dwarfed. Then the
weather changes; the air turns raw and damp, and day
seemingly forgets Wastwater. Silent, implacable, falls
the rain. Down almost to the water trail the ragged
cloud-beards&mdash;they choke day from the low land. Up
the mountains&mdash;he is a hardy wight who dares to
be there. Half-molten snowdrifts, torrents roaring,
cascading from unseen above to invisible below, gouts
of water cleaving through the mistwreaths. But
seldom does such a wanderer brave the elements long.
Turgid torrents and close-enwrapping fogs charm
no one. Indoors the fires burn bright; save for a
brief space about noon, when a sickly lightening
proclaims day&rsquo;s climax and glory, the lamps are hardly
out. To the gloom of the clouded sky is added
the great shadows of close-hemming mountains; there
are houses among the fells on which for three months
of the year the sun never shines.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Wastwater, and the Screes. Three miles of buttresses
crumbling down in fan-shaped beds of ruin.
It is grand to pace the opposite shore and watch
the play of light and shade on the rugged mountainside.
Streaked with rich brown are some of the
yawning gullies: up there are stores of ruddle or
native iron. Soft and soluble as mud, the substance
once had a value as providing an indelible mark for
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
sheep. The shepherd lads from distant dales came
here to collect it&mdash;for a premium of sixpence per
pound from their masters. On the brink and halfway
down the face of the shivery rocks are the little veins
of ruddle found. A steady step and a firm nerve had
the lads who dared such labour, for a misstep might
split their foothold to pieces and throw them far
down the ravines. We are told that many lives were
lost in the pursuit of ruddle: compared with it,
modern rock-climbing, with the skilfully used safeguards,
is safe, though of course far more arduous.
The climber of to-day chooses a sound crag for his
work: the ruddle-gatherer could only work among
the loosest, craziest ground.</p>
<p>The best way to see the Screes is to take a boat
and row close to them. High above your head, a
great rampart of rock, scored since the world began
with the cabalistic record of frost and storm, hides the
sky. Somewhere betwixt the crags and lake, following
the smoothest route, is a rough path. In and out
of parks of huge boulders (many, geologists say, still
sliding downwards at speeds varying from slothful
inches to a bustling six feet per annum), the track
threads, affording a grand though tiring walk. After
frost there is danger in approaching some of the crags.
Huge breasts of stone are so finely hung that the
ice wedging their crannies rends them as surely as
gunpowder. There have been some tremendous rockfalls
in the Screes. A century ago one of the sights
of Wastwater was a lofty fragment to which an uncouth
imagination gave the name of Wilson&rsquo;s Horse. For
long the vicinity had been shunned: pieces of rock
were for ever disintegrating from the mass. Then,
after a winter grim with frost and snow, came the
final catastrophe. At dead of night was heard the roar
of falling rock, and at daybreak the Horse had
disappeared. Judging from the splintery gulf whence
the Horse fell, &ldquo;What a splash it must have made!&rdquo;
interjected one as we scrambled about the place. It
is said that a twenty-foot wave passed north and south
after the rock struck the water.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Wastwater, the home of many shepherds. As you
scramble their flocks are ever around you. And from
among desolate-looking rocks, between beds of lichened
boulders, they obtain sustenance. There is a tuft of
grass just by that patch of parsley fern; a little fringe
of soft green nestles beneath that boulder; a skin of
living verdure finds root where the scree lies fine
as dust. For these wisps of grass the hardy Herdwicks
assiduously search, and on such meagre fare they thrive.
Our sheep are small in size compared with those of
the lowlands but more robust, and so intelligent that
no dweller in the mountain-land can understand that
cant phrase &ldquo;a silly sheep.&rdquo; There are other animals
with far less resource or real initiative when faced by
danger. The life of the mountain shepherd possesses
little of Arcadian joy and pastoral romance. The
stress of winter when storm sweeps down from the Gable
and the air is riotous with snow, the terrible &ldquo;clash&rdquo; at
lambing-time when the weather turns wet for weeks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
militate against such idylls as are fancied in brighter
lands. So ruthless is fact in its war with poetic vapourings
that even the glories of the shepherd&rsquo;s summer
do not remain. Instead of the shepherd piping and
watching the sheep with lambs by their sides streaming
over green swelling hills, in the English mountain-land
it is the season of the detested maggot. This cruel
pest burrows through wool and skin into the living
flesh beneath and devours that. It is almost too
sickening to recall the piteous scenes of visible spines
and ribs from which the flesh has been denuded; of
sheep still living in the most awful agony. Nearly
the worst characteristic of this terrible visitation is
that a sheep when attacked generally turns recluse
and wanders as far as possible from its fellows. Thus,
when the shepherd should theoretically be at ease, he
is really, ointment pot in hand, climbing about the
roughest parts of his holding. Once, when wandering
near Wastwater, I met a shepherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been salving?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, been trying to find some to salve. I&rsquo;ve a
mind they&rsquo;re somewhere in these ghylls, but I can&rsquo;t
come at &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many do you reckon there&rsquo;ll be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mappen sebben or eight. I&rsquo;m going to try this
beck course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a few up
above.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="690" />
<p class="caption">WASTDALEHEAD CHURCH
<br />The smallest in the district&mdash;perhaps in England</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Then I explained that from across the mere I
had noticed a few white dots, and had entered into
remarks thereon with one who through field glasses
was scanning the great hillside. He could scarce
believe that the small grey masses cluthering in the
ghyll were sheep. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re far too still.&rdquo; I admitted
the mournful fact, also that they were much
above the zone of grass, but added that they were
&ldquo;smitten by wicks.&rdquo; The shepherd assured that this
was the very ghyll, up we went. It was not long
before we came to the lowest&mdash;I dare not say animal.
So weak and emaciated was the living organism from
ravages of the terrible maggot that the shepherd
immediately kicked out its brain. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t save it,&rdquo;
he muttered through set teeth. The next was not so
far gone. The shepherd, with deft hands, cut away
the clotted wool and speedily the cleansing ointment
was at work. The plunging and baa-ing of the
sheep showed that the cure was a &ldquo;smarty&rdquo; one.
One by one the other sheep were found and remedies
applied, so that the shepherd went back to the farm
at rest.</p>
<p>Wastwater, haunt of the char and the botling, the
latter a mysterious fish. Now and again he turned
up, and his appearance spread dread through the
country-side&mdash;what had not happened when last this
hermit fish came ashore? Fever and agues were by
some said to follow his occurrence, or trouble about
heafage rights. But progressive science scared him
from existence (the botling was ever a male) with
his little hoard of lore. The fish was taken at the
fall of the year in the little becks and among spawning
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
trout. He was a powerful fellow, differing chiefly
from his associates in greater size and thickness, and
in the manner in which his under jaw turned up
and was hooked. In weight the botling ranged from
four to twelve pounds. One killed by leister, or fish
spear, was so thick that its girth was in excess of
its length by four inches. In colour and marking
the botling resembled the ordinary lake trout, the
brown spots on its back being only proportionately
larger. Probably it was only a local variation of
<i>Salmo ferox</i> (the great lake trout); it might possibly
have been a hybrid fish. At any rate, here the
argument must be left: for half a century the
botling has not been heard of&mdash;his train of woe,
however, has not been so considerate.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Like our other lakes, Wastwater is most fishable
when a faint breeze ruffles its waters&mdash;for the benefit
of the visitor-angler, the coch y bondhu and Broughton
Point are the best general flies, with red hackle during
the summer. There is little sport with the char: the
lake-bed does not permit netting, and the fish are
not present in sufficient numbers to encourage the
use of the plumb-line. One of my old acquaintance
was wont to walk from Langdale over the mountains
to fish here, in the days of the now proscribed lath.
Poor old Tom, it needs a vivid imagination to
picture thy age-wrung frame climbing steep Rossett
Ghyll, to think of thy dim old eyes as alert enough
to seek out the path as in semi-darkness thou wandered
among bogs and benks, screes and boulders. Still
more difficult is it to see thee bending over the lead-weighted
board with its twin lines and their droppers
of gut, fly, and barb, keen to get the instrument on
its journey. In one of the coves where purls down
a rivulet, the lath is launched; the faint current carries
it outward till the breeze ruffling the lake catches
its upturned edge. Twenty yards out, where the lake
sheers down to its great depth, fish are lying, taking
what food air and stream drift to them. Slowly the
lath sails outward, Tom unwinding further line as
required. The board is now, thinks Tom, beyond
the shoal, and the droppers should be presenting their
temptations to the fish. Its movement is therefore
checked, and the linesman waits for the fish to bite.
Tom&rsquo;s right hand after a while draws one end of the
lath nearer, the breeze catches it and it floats sidewise.
To the right is a few yards of water from which
Tom has previously taken good fish. In an hour
he rises from the shadows, and draws the board
slowly to land. At first the lines come steadily
enough, and are coiled neatly; then there is greater
resistance. The right line jerks about in all directions:
here comes a big trout. A faint ruffle breaks
from a back fin just beneath the surface, there is a
little wimple as the fish sinks down again. Gently,
gently Tom draws in line. Now there is a brisk curl
quite close to his feet near the rocks, a few splashes,
and Tom is handling a half-pounder. So strong was
the tackle used for lath-fishing that no delicate precision,
little fine &ldquo;play,&rdquo; was requisite. Poor old Tom!
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
Hadst thou then a taste for the picturesque, what lovely
memories thou must be revelling in now when in age
thine eye to outward things grows dim! Nights by
lovely mountain tarns, when the northward light made
the water glow like steel, when the great ribs of the
mountains seemed in their nakedness to support the
dome of night. Star-spangled skies, and the soft mists
of summer by the lake-shore when everything droned to
rest. The adventure Tom remembers best is of Wastwater.
A keeper had suspected lathing on the western
shore, and secreted himself to watch. Tom came over
from Langdale, and near Yewbarrow made ready his
lines. The board floating out attracted the keeper&rsquo;s
attention. He was mounted, and rode as fast as he
could to cut off the poacher. Tom heard the thud of
hooves on the soft grass, threw his lines into the
mere, and made up the hillside as fast as he could run.
A few score yards the horseman pursued, but the
poacher managed to cross a deep but narrow gully
which the keeper&rsquo;s pony could not leap. Then, as
Tom quaintly remarks, &ldquo;He thought he hed hed enew
on&rsquo;t, and turned back to the lake. But I got my lines
and board in spite of all. Aye, and there was about
twenty pounds of fish on &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig36">

<p class="caption">WASTDALEHEAD, WASTWATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Wastwater&mdash;its memories are quite innumerable.
On cycle the western shore is not difficult. The road
undulates, but its surface is fair. It was a warm
afternoon; rain had fallen during the previous night,
but bright sunshine and sweeping breeze had dried up
the exposed portions of the road, though under the
trees it was still muddy. We started from Santon
Bridge, a sweet hamlet in the gorge of the Irt, not
usually found by those whose faces are toward
Wastwater. For a couple of miles the road was up,
up, and the hills were long; then down, down, down,
and the descents were merry. And the Screes rose
loftier in front, and looked more and more broken.
Soon the level blue of Wastwater comes in sight
over larch-tops. Then, as we pedal into a beech
avenue, the full view is lost, but we see a succession
of entrancing vistas: narrow shafts of meadow and
woodland, of water and upspringing screes, framed
in by dainty sprays of copper foliage. Through the
tunnel of overhanging boughs is a glimpse of open
moor and of distant fell. The road declines and our
speed increases. To northward we see almost the full
length of the mere; the faint breeze is urging the
water to gayest laughter. The Screes, with their
rainbow hues of native coal and iron, of green slate
and brown conglomerate, are opposite. The afternoon
sun is playing about their gullies: in some we see
long, thin cascades, but between the cliffs fringing
other ravines is a straight, heavy shadow. In there,
unseen by the sun, the water jets and sprays in leaden
glories; no rainbow dances in the soft white veils;
dank, slimy cave-ferns grow in plenty.</p>
<p>Our road now passes into the wild moorland&mdash;terrace
after terrace of hillocks we wind through,
keeping near the lake&rsquo;s level. The feature in this
approach to Wastwater head is Yewbarrow. Seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
from other points this seems rather tame, but from
here it is impressive, commanding the whole view.
The lake is still waving under the influence of the
breeze; green, green and gold are the hillsides with
grass and bracken. Among the stones the staghorn
moss threads, sending up club-like spikes in profusion;
every boulder is fringed with parsley fern.
Yewbarrow, always changing shape, now appears as
if cloven by a chasm from the great mass of
mountains, and the name of the chasm is Bowderdale.
There is heather by the roadside now, its tufts
perfect masses of bloom, and the broom&rsquo;s yellow glory
is not wanting. In half a mile we leave the desolation
of rock and grass&mdash;here are trees and even a few pieces
of hedges, rowan and hawthorn, with a few scrubby
oaks. The level plain of Wastdale head appears
in front; we coast round guardian Yewbarrow, pass
cottage and farm as far as the road serves, then push
our machines to the church of the dale. Now the
weather changes. The brilliant sunshine suddenly
glooms and dies away. I look up to Great Gable,
weather oracle of the glen&mdash;and am surprised. Half
an hour ago a fluffy cloud seemed resting on it, but
now a dark mass of vapour, distended with wind and
bearded with unshed rain, has taken its place. And
over the pass from Ennerdale on the left, and through
the gully from Borrowdale on the right, the hosts of
storm cloud are boiling. A contrary gust whispers
a shrill warning; we seek shelter at once, but with
a seething and a roar the storm is upon us, lashing
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
rain-lines in our faces. Fifty yards away the vicar&rsquo;s
house offers shelter&mdash;we are not acquaintances, but&mdash;&mdash; In
three minutes we are in his kitchen, looking out
toward the glen of Mosedale. At first nothing more
is visible than a grey mass of whirling rain, then, for
a summer storm is but brief, again the flanks of the
nearer fells come in sight. The pall passes rapidly,
and the sunshine is pouring over the spine of Yewbarrow
before the last rush of rain has streamed
down the hospitable window. Ere long, the glen is
again rejoicing in sunshine; the grass sparkles with
fairy gems, the streaming crags are touched into shields
of silver, the hoary crown of Gable seems to brighten
as though the new spirit of life below made even
it, the monarch, rejoice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small"><i>THE GLORY OF ENNERDALE</i></span></h2>
<p>Lying beyond the pale of great mountains, and
only connected by rugged passes with other
sights of Lakeland, the lake of Ennerdale does not
attract many tourists. The approach to it, otherwise
than by mountain road, is circuitous; the traveller,
coming by ordinary routes from the outside world,
is carried across a great ironworking district, where
every stream runs red mud, and where black smeltery
smoke hangs low. Yet Ennerdale in its own peculiar
fashion is beautiful.</p>
<p>In my early days the lake seemed connected, in my
mind, with stories of pirates and privateers&mdash;Paul Jones
hovered on the coast near by till a gale drove him
and his cursing hordes out to sea&mdash;and as more intimate
knowledge came to me I still found Ennerdale
connected with illicit seafaring. Smugglers&mdash;and my
ancestors are reputed to have been among the most
active of these&mdash;landed cargoes in the coves about
St. Bees Head. From there goods were sent northward
by the coast to Carlisle and the Border, and
eastward over the fells to Penrith, Kendal, and distant
towns and villages of the Pennine. The first route
was early closed, but that over the passes baffled the
revenue officers for years. The head of Ennerdale
was quite out of the world then. The smugglers built
rough <i>caches</i> to store their loads in wild weather, and
even engineered with skill a path over Great Gable
in the direction of Borrowdale. To-day this green
band is known as Moses&rsquo;s Sledgate. Moses, however,
was not a smuggler, but an illicit distiller who, after
the decline of the finer art, reared his &ldquo;worm&rdquo; in the
wilderness.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">

<p class="caption">ENNERDALE LAKE AT SUNSET</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>A long climb over grassy open common brings the
cyclist from Egremont to Ennerdale bridge: that
irregular knot of houses, with its moss-veiled church,
was in the past a mountain metropolis. Wordsworth&rsquo;s
poem, &ldquo;The Brothers,&rdquo; centres in this churchyard of
the dale. As the poet thought out his theme, through
his mind there must have passed memories of that
grand, encircling chain of mountains, rugged Revelin,
precipiced Pillar, and scree-strewn Iron Crag, with many
more. Only in one real particular was the licence
poetic indulged, for there were gravestones here, modest
indeed, flat among smothering grasses or fringing the
boundary walls.</p>
<p>Perhaps not at Ennerdale, but in equally remote
districts, the church was used by smugglers. Under
the rush-laid floor, cellars were dug to contain kegs of
liquor, the miserably paid parsons conniving, often
acting as selling agents. Church attendance would
doubtless arouse more enthusiasm among grown men
in days when the spent bottle could be exchanged
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
after service for a full one, and there were &ldquo;lashings&rdquo;
to drink beside. In one place where the parson could
not be brought to see his &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; the kirkgarth was
often tenanted by most eerie &ldquo;corpse lights,&rdquo; and had
to be shunned accordingly by all honest folks and
preventive men. Those &ldquo;in the know,&rdquo; however&mdash;and
they were many&mdash;knew that brandy and rum
would be plentiful next day, for a new supply of
liquor had been hid in a raised vault, from which
the parish clerk drew it as need arose.</p>
<p>From Ennerdale bridge the road climbs a couple of
miles to the lake: in fact it somewhat overclimbs, for
when at last the mere is viewed the wanderer is about
three hundred feet too high, and has to descend by a
very steep route to the Anglers Inn. That first
glimpse is splendid: for half a mile back the hedgerows
have prevented the eyes from wandering far, then
suddenly bursts the glory. The waters deep beneath
follow the mood of the day; laugh and sparkle when
the sun shines and a warm breeze whispers; well
gloomy and leaden when a host of clouds presses the
mountains and shadows the lake-basin; swoon tender
and soft when evening&rsquo;s purple vapour drifts through
passes and over summits, to collect in a pool in the
valley beneath; surge and heave in breakers when a
gale sweeps through the air; brood silent and sombre
and still as a slab of jet when winter clothes the sky
with deepest blue and the steeps with majesty of
white.</p>

<p>I prefer a boat for exploring the beauties of
Ennerdale Water within and without, for the road to
Gillerthwaite is rough, and the path by Anglers Crag
not without some difficulty. Ennerdale within is
represented by some fine trout and by an occasional
char. On this lake the char in early autumn will come
to the lure of a red ant. These insects at this season
develop feeble wings; they haunt the sandy soil near
the lake and are for ever essaying flights. A slight
breeze is enough to sweep whole crowds of them over
the water; they fly to the end of their strength, fall
into the lake and are snapped up by the fish which
lie in wait near the surface. In winter the char resort
to the main stream entering the lake, for the purpose
of spawning. For many years a certain part of the
beck was known as the Char Dub, for in it, in numbers
sufficient to render the bottom invisible, the shoals of
fish lay. At the present day, however, the diminished
char elect to spawn on a shingle further up the stream.</p>
<p>For its trout-fishing Ennerdale is justly noted:
there can be little finer sport than trolling here, the
boat moving slowly on, the waves lap-a-lap against
its timbers. When the attention is taken from the
water, what a fine panorama of steep and rocky
mountains!</p>
<p>Maytime among the mountains&mdash;a day of soft
creeping shadows and warm sunlight, the firmament
white with lofty clouds, though here and there a wide
rag of blue shows between. The boat welts away from
the pier; clack, clack, fall the oars on to their pins,
a moment later, to a rumble and a churn of water,
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
the rower falls to work. Local men do not use the
rowlock and the feathering oar; a rigid pin is fitted
on the side of the boat upon which a perforation in
the oarshaft slots. The contrivance has undoubted
advantages to anglers, as the oars do not need to be
lifted inboard when not in use; secure on their pins
they can trail through the water. But why all lake
boats should be so fitted is beyond comprehension, for
the superiority of the rowlock and the feathering
oar is palpable: a boat can be pulled faster and
more easily, and in moments of danger&mdash;which on
a day of sudden squalls are frequent&mdash;are not less
reliable.</p>
<p>As our boat slips away, the upper lake, a field of
splendid blue, comes in sight. In mid-lake a tuft of
rock claims attention&mdash;the boat glides to it over the
faint ripples. It proves indeed to be a cluster of loose
fragments, pushed up from the lake-floor to be a
resting-place for the birds of land and water. So
piled are the stones that it seems impossible human
hands have not been busy in the midst of this waste of
waters. Anglers and others have proved by crude
methods that the protrusion is the crest of a sheer
column of rock, or rocks as the case may be. If the
figures confidently given are approximately correct,
when, if ever, Ennerdale runs dry, an inaccessible
pinnacle will be found to puzzle our rock gymnasts.
Herons alight here to meditate and digest their toll
of troutlets; and swift warriors of the air, buzzard,
peregrine, and more humble sparrow-hawk, hover down
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
to the islet-rock to rest and plan anew their forays.
When afloat on Ennerdale the mountains, with infinite
variety of shadow and gleam, rock and grass and
downpouring water, demand most of my attention. I
seldom look to the lake&rsquo;s outlet: it is a comparatively
flat scene if your boat is past the rugged slopes of
Revelin. A long larch-wood fringes the shore&mdash;its
monotonous blob of green in strong contrast to the
livelier fellside dabbed with creamy, blooming hawthorns.
Next to it, over a knot of buildings, rises an unsightly
shaft of brick, belonging to a long-disused thread
mill. The effect of rectangular wood and cylindrical
chimney is dreary, stupid; it apes a modernity which
here, in God&rsquo;s wilderness, is at least unpicturesque.</p>
<p>Our vigorous friend at the oars has meanwhile
brought us close to Anglers Crag. The bottom of
the lake remains invisible, though the boat&rsquo;s nose grates
against the sheering rock; looking over the side,
through the clear water, the slabs drop lower and
lower till gathering gloom hides them from sight. The
&ldquo;crag&rdquo; above, though steep, is quite climbable; it is
worth while going ashore to scramble for ten minutes.
The boat accordingly turns into a narrow bay where
we may land on a beach of shelving shingle. The
bank above is plenteously strewed with slabs of rock,
though the &ldquo;crag&rdquo; is to our right. Up the hillside
we find our view rapidly extending to westward,
though the mountains still hem us in on all other
sides. Shortly the sea is visible beyond smoky West
Cumberland. The forms of shipping can be made
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
out, sailing the channels through the shoals of Solway.
And farther away still, if the day be clear, the hills
of Scotland rise in an undulating line of blue. St.
Bees Head is the only feature in a comparatively
regular shore: a mass of sandstone, it sheers up four
hundred feet above the strand. Here, on its very
crest, once was a monastery, the lands of which were
won by a miracle. St. Bega and her zealots landed
hereabouts and found the people worshippers of strange
Norse gods, unwilling to hear the new gospel and
impatient for the visitors to be gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your God is almighty!&rdquo; sneered the chief,
&ldquo;I will give you all the land in my domain that to-morrow
bears snow. Your God is almighty; and
you need nothing from humans&mdash;ask Him, then, for
snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morrow was Midsummer Day; at early morn
the folks of the country rose to find a mantle of cold,
glistering white covering nearly all the land betwixt
mountain and sea. The chief&rsquo;s jest was, so runs the
tale, carried out in full, and through war and peace
the monks held to their inheritance till smooth King
Henry divided their lands to others.</p>
<p>Down we come to the lake edge again, to raid the
haunt of coot and heron&mdash;both birds not rare on
Ennerdale Lake, the quietude of which is just perfect.
Our boat floats in as wild and savage a scene as is
to be made by mere and fell. The Char Dub is visited,
the huge mass of Pillar Crag noted at as near a point
as possible. Now, coasting barren fields above which
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
the skylarks are trilling, and by shores decked with
star-primroses, we return from the wilderness to the
forest lands of oak and ash and alder.</p>
<p>Ennerdale Lake, though less visited than the other
waters, is in its way as beauteous as they.</p>

<br /><span class="small"><i>BY SOFT LOWESWATER</i></span></h2>
<p>Close enfolded in the lap of mountains, Loweswater
is seldom seen by the casual tourist. At
Scale Hill, a rugged ravine with a white river dashing
down, is pointed as the direction in which it lies.
At the sight of that crag-set hillside the cyclist turns
regretfully and, down the good Lorton road, speeds
away for Cockermouth or Keswick. Yet if the writer
were compelled to seek another home among the Lakes,
after Rothay&rsquo;s magic glen he would select Loweswater.
And there are others who would do likewise, who year
after year come to the little secluded lake for holiday.
For tell it not loudly, its trouting is the best in the
Lake Country. The angling is not public, but it is
possible to obtain permission for a week&rsquo;s pleasure.
The trout rule large for our northern waters, fish of
over three pounds being landed every season.</p>

<p class="caption">LOWESWATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>As mentioned already, the lake is hidden in the
flank of Mellbreak, the front of which sheds scree and
occasional boulders into Crummock. For ages the dell
was a stronghold of the &rsquo;statesmen who lived on their
own holdings, but as hard times came the mischievous
jointure system caused one small estate after another
to come into the market. Lucky the monied in that
dark era: the farmers grew despondent as their
obligations increased. After centuries of abstemity
rum and whisky began to be relished, with dire results.
Wool which for long had stood at a good price
fell rapidly to almost a nominal figure. Desperate
farmers did not market their &ldquo;clips&rdquo; for several
seasons in the hope that times would mend. But old
stock was finally sold at whatever price offered. The
vast imports from the new Australian colonies in the
middle of last century thus completed the destruction
which the Repeal of the Corn Laws began. Some
who do not wish to see a return to Protectionism
point out patches cumbered with heather where wheat
was cultivated in those days of inflated prices. To
force up prices that such wastes might become profitable,
they say, would not benefit the farmer, the
shepherd, or the dalesman now, as it did not in the past.
The opponents to this view point with equal confidence
to the days when the &rsquo;statesman was firm on his own
soil, living and working at profit enough to pay
out the jointures placed on him in his father&rsquo;s anxiety
to &ldquo;do fair by his own.&rdquo; A change, they sigh, might
bring back those happy days. I take no side, save
to say that the highest tariff imaginable cannot bring
back the worthy, faulty &rsquo;statesman families. They are
gone for ever. Strangers dwell within their gates, and
till their fields.</p>
<p>There are no great houses round Loweswater, no
castle was ever built in this domain of peace. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
ancient farms, with their guardian yews, speak of gone
days. I never see the twin trees by a farmstead with
the inevitable box edge from gate to door without
thinking of the old custom of setting a bowl of box
in the porch of the house where a corpse was lying.
Every one who visited was expected to take a sprig.
Box grows slowly&mdash;the hedge planted by a man is
hardly seen at maturity by his great-grandson; the
Cumbrian peasant custom must have been an effectual
reminder to all of man&rsquo;s narrow span on earth.</p>
<p>To me Loweswater is a great reminder of olden
days. No glaring hotel, no road traversed by hooting
motor-cars or rattling coaches. A man can sit far
up the slope of Mellbreak, look down on placid water
and quiet vale, and allow his mind to ramble back
fifty or a hundred years. He can re-picture the old
glen and its society. First the priest. His church
was small, his stipend ditto. As he was the head
of society, christening babies, marrying the grown,
and burying the dead, so the schoolmaster was generally
the opposite. He was ordinarily despised, whereas the
parson sometimes was revered. During the week
the vicar was a farmer among farmers; he had a
tithe of wool, could have sheep free on the heafs
above the enclosures, which his parishioners had to
look after. He took tithe of the sheaves at harvest,
and of every kind of produce. The greater part of
the schoolmaster&rsquo;s remuneration was in the shape of
victuals: he went &ldquo;whittle-gate&rdquo; by turns to the
home of his pupils, living a week here, a week there.
He was scrivener and will-maker to the parish where
the priest did not take that office. He taught but
few subjects: reading, writing, little arithmetic. But
sometimes there was Latin and Greek and Hebrew for
the really studious, as behind ale-soaked clothes, and
in a fuddled brain, a schoolmaster might possess real
classical knowledge. On the other hand, men who
had had accidents at other callings, or were too worthless
for manual labour, drifted into the teaching
profession. Knowing only the merest rudiments and
careless of learning more, they could not benefit the
children, and were often a fearful example for them.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">

<p class="caption">THE OLD POST OFFICE, LOWESWATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>One of the main amusements of old dales-life in
winter was dancing, either at merry nights, or at what
were called &ldquo;dancing classes.&rdquo; To provide the music
for these lived a class of wandering minstrels. What
lives they led! I well remember poor old Tim, the
last of these to come within my sight. He came to
our knot of houses just as dusk was falling. He
carried his fiddle in a green bag, and as he neared,
took out the instrument and tuned a single string.
Then his old voice trolled out, &ldquo;Home, sweet home,&rdquo;
in faltering accents as he walked back and forward.
Ages ago minstrels played by the hearths of the
great, and sang the legends of golden renown: here
Tim, tottering, his fiddle almost in ruins, his voice
quavering over the well-known words, trying to get
from poor cottagers enough to buy drink, or a night&rsquo;s
lodging. Poor Tim! His story was sad. He had
money left him when he was a hard-working shoemaker
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
nearly thirty years of age. To that time his only
solace had been in music. The legacy turned his
head, and in a short six months he was ruined. The
little shop where he had mended boots was in the hands
of the bailiffs, his wife and children were on the road
with him. For awhile they travelled together, then
the children were rescued by relatives&mdash;the poor wife
dragged along alone in the wake of the drunken fiddler.
At last too she faded away, died by a snow-covered
roadside, and Tim went down to the bed-rock of
despair. &ldquo;I want no money, give me ale.&rdquo; Fiddling
here, and singing there till his voice gave way, he
wandered a score years. Many tried to rescue him;
once his little shop was restored him and for a whole
summer he stuck to his &ldquo;last.&rdquo; But with dark nights,
music was required at the inn, and he was tempted
again. He trailed himself across from one merrymaking
to another. He lived as he might; he slept as
he could. And the morning before I saw him a farmer
walking on the top of his hay-mow stepped on something
that cracked. &ldquo;Dash thee! thoo&rsquo;s brokken my
fiddle, and I&rsquo;ll hae to play at t&rsquo; Ploo to-neet.&rdquo; As he
felt old age and death creeping on him, he wandered
away from the country-side which was his home, and
put miles of flat country between him and the
mountains before the final call.</p>
<p>Another person who knew much of the dale in the
old time would be the dumb fortune-teller. Persons
without the power of speech were always credited in
Cumbria with divination. The fortune-tellers were the
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
most respectable of vagabonds: they worked satisfactorily
and were well paid. No gloomy forecast
was ever to my knowledge delivered. I have seen
many of their hieroglyphs, some in picture-writing,
promising untold good to the person who had consulted
them. But the gipsies were, and are, another matter.
The pedlar, too, was a well-known figure; with his
pack on back he would go from farm to farm, selling
all sorts of little tempting things.</p>
<p>To come to the lake at last. It is one of our
smaller meres, and the quietest. It lies in a land of
meadows, but lofty hillsides rise above its glen. No
boats are kept for public use, but a visitor can usually
arrange a loan with some farmer. Loweswater is not
a lake to exhaust in one afternoon: the cunning ones
lodge by the week at the clean, comfortable farms,
enjoying the plain fare of rural Cumberland with a
delight bred of open air and keen exercise. The rod
is hardly ever from the waters, except for a siesta
at midday&mdash;and not then if the day be overcast, with
a warm breeze kissing the water and enticing broods of
new insects from the depths. There are no char in
Loweswater, though attempts have been made at
introduction: probably the water is hardly deep enough
to suit it.</p>
<p>To row out on a warm summer night and to fish
here from midnight to dawn is a splendid experience.
Though along the northern ridges a pale night-glow
glimmers and fades, and the stars like diamonds glitter
in the light blue above, down on the level waters
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
everything is gloom. The man resting on his oars
is a dark shadow: your companion&rsquo;s &ldquo;kent&rdquo; face,
though he has turned toward the light, is a patch of
featureless grey. To see your fly it must be held high
enough to come between your eyes and the narrow
swathe of light on the horizon. Your boat drifts
through the prattling wavelets slowly, slowly. Then
along the line comes the expected tremor: a fish at
last. No use trying to play him&mdash;get him to the
surface: your tackle is strong enough to take some
risks. Your rod responds to its struggles, yet you
cannot guess where the trout is. Perhaps it may rush
to the top and set up a faint wimple that catches
the night light. In a few minutes, however, the fish
is tired out and you draw it alongside. The largest of
trout are nocturnal feeders, and the angler is occasionally
delighted by very heavy fish. Persons unaccustomed
to night on the water assert that the silence is almost
appalling: save for the ripples against the timbers
there is no sound. To me, however, there is pleasure
in that far-off whistle of an otter; in the churrs
and twitters, hoots and shrieks, of night birds. There
is a romance in gloom of which garish day knows
nothing. The fairy world visits you again, and you
witness gay revels in the starlight.</p>
<p>The lake to the angler, the hillside and the meadows
to the wanderer, are the charms of the vale. He who
is not satisfied with the softly trawling boat, the midge-worried
hour of non-success, can ramble in the woods
and fields, with their glories of sedge and iris and
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
cloying meadow-sweet, and up the rivulets dancing
down shadowy ghylls. Climb the shoulder of Mellbreak,
sit down every five minutes and look around.
By this method a full enjoyment of the peaceful vale
will be obtained. Notice the nearest things&mdash;the rose
beetles: your friend down below in the green old boat
will be sighing for such a one as that just turned
over; and that crushing mass of parsley fern which,
though the whole hillside is open to it, sticks close
by that grey, weathered stone. The lake is now quite
small below, a mere dot shows you the lazily floating
boat: think scornfully now of the angler and his petty
work. Look beyond, the great moors rolling toward
St. Bees, the hills fining down to the North Cumberland
plain, the Derwent here and there gleaming between
banks of living green. Criffel and the Dumfries-shire
hills, across the Solway. A patch of smoke shows
the cathedral city of Carlisle, and you feel a pity for
the workers under that pall. They think they see
the sun shine, but you in a purer air rejoice in a
more life-giving light than that pale gleam they praise.
The bracken too is here, unfolding its last tendrils,
and away goes a single red grouse with a mighty
whirr and a squauking &ldquo;Go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound of human and canine voices comes now to
the ear; and turning an outstanding rock, we come
immediately to a busy scene. It is a sheep-washing; to
the clamour of dogs, and the whistling and shouting of
shepherds, are added the bleatings of two thousand sheep.
One drove is on the hillside above marshalled by a pair
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
of collies, another is below, threading an almost unseen
track toward some distant holding. A shepherd is in
charge of these, his dogs scouting to right and left.
No straggler can bolt into the confusion of sheep in
the little glen. Here a dam has been built just below
a rudely piled fold. The sheep are driven into an
outer court, then drafted into a small inner space.
From this they are thrown into the water, which has
been collecting since yesterday (so meagre is the stream),
where men standing waist deep catch them. Holding
the sheep&rsquo;s head above water these quickly pass hands
back and forward over the fleece, raising it so that
water penetrates to the under-wool. This done to satisfaction
the sheep are allowed to swim out. When one
flock has been washed, it is sent to the portion of
unfenced hillside from which it came. The scene is
one of bustle; the work is arduous too, some of the
men have been collecting and driving down their
flocks since early dawn. Shortly after the washing,
comes the day of &ldquo;clipping,&rdquo; when the fleece is removed,
but the days of great &ldquo;clippings&rdquo; are past.
Wool becomes ripe at different periods; and instead
of treating the flock on a certain day only, the
shepherd now shears as fast as fleeces are ready.</p>
<p>Standing above the washing pool we look down on the
little animated patch&mdash;the struggling ewes, the water
turgid with &ldquo;dip,&rdquo; the skilful men in water and on
land, the &rsquo;cute collies watching their master&rsquo;s flock
and allowing no stranger to enter it. Beyond the dry
stones of the river-bed, in a vista bounded by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
steep sides of the gully, we see the lake in all its
beauty. Woods, fields, diminished with distance, yet
seem but over the brink of the chasm there.</p>
<p>Now from heather and bracken we return to green
pastures and to the little ivied farmhouse, with old-fashioned
doorway and chimney, which is our temporary
home. All is peace around: the rookery is
hardly heard across the intervening fields; the raven,
in the blue above, scarce in all its wheels and hovers
sends down one menacing croak. The day is spent,
and up the western sky spreads a suffuse of crimson,
flecked with wisps of cloud; at last night draws on,
softly, bluely, creeping into the hollows of the hills and
into the deeper shadows; the radiant lake dies from
crimson to grey, and then, to the clatter of rowlocks,
our boat comes home to the grassy pier.</p>

<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small"><i>CRUMMOCK WATER</i></span></h2>
<p>Two chief routes bring you easily to Crummock
Water&mdash;the first to Scale Hill at its foot, the
other to its head, over Newlands Hause. From northward,
as you approach, the hills on either side the vale
of Lorton rise to higher flights, to greater ruggedness.
At Scale Hill there is a sudden glimpse up the lake,
a silvery level stretching far into the mountain land.
Your way has wound round a great tumulus of rock
and larch and oak which chokes the vale, to bring you
so quickly to this lovely view.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig41">
<img src="images/p40.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="693" />
<p class="caption">CRUMMOCK WATER, FROM SCALE HILL</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Wild and stern is Crummock. All is particularly
gloomy and forlorn on an afternoon threatening snow.
The hillsides start up grey and stark and desolate. The
only sounds you hear are the occasional yelp of a sheep
dog in the fields near by and the sulky croak of a raven,
a black spot up there where a grim cloud is hovering,
shutting out the life of day, and sending the weather-wise
sheep cluthering to sheltered spots by ghyll and
fence. Suddenly the grey firmament above drops
on to the hilltops and smothers them. Then snow
begins to flutter, first in single flakes, then in a small
shower which grimes the nearer fields and paths.
Finally the storm giant asserts himself and a continuous
shadow of white falls around. That far-off mist-wall
which showed the head of the vale is shut off; only a
few yards of grey lake trembling and tossing into little
waves as the north wind harries it. At such a time
it is well to seek shelter, for the gale may be wild
and strong as day dies, and the snow fall in winding
sheets. Rather, then, turn indoors and listen to stories
of stress&mdash;the shepherd can tell you of peril faced for
the sake of his flock; the postman, of danger in his
daily round: men as wild and strong and devoted
in their way as pioneer-heroes in a cannibal land, and
as deserving to furnish matter for stories of renown.
Through rain and shine, when torrents brawl havoc,
rending bridges like straws, when drifts hide even the
tall tree tops,&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The service admits not a &lsquo;but&rsquo; or an &lsquo;if&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and the gritty postman, by one device or another,
wins through with his mails to solitary farm or wild
moorland hamlet. And they live long, despite their
hardships, as witness one who, after a day&rsquo;s wrestle with
the unbanded elements, was asked how he fared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, man, it&rsquo;s wild on t&rsquo; top. I tried to git ower
t&rsquo; moor, but I couldn&rsquo;t. I gat to that lile [little] black
planting, hooivver, aboot halfway, and I rested a bit.
Then I said to mesel, I said, &lsquo;Noo, Wat, thoo&rsquo;s faced
it four and fifty year, thoo sureli isn&rsquo;t gaen to gie
in noo.&rsquo; And at that I set tull again, and I gat ower;
but it was hard wark, mindst ta.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>By calm hearth the dalesmen tell their stories; the
gale rumbles against the house, and the windows tinkle
to the driving of snowflakes. By morning the storm
has passed, the ground is deep in snow, sky and
hilltops are clear, stars still shine down on a scene
of quietness and savage peace. Soon dawn-beams fire
the east, and the summits are touched with rose.
With full day the greyness clinging to the mountain
flanks disappears, revealing riven glens and beetling
crags. A boat is being launched for an expedition
to seek what wild fowl may during the storm have
taken refuge on the lake, and on it we go. On the
open water the cold is terrible; pulling with might
and main would hardly relieve the numbness of hands
and feet, but our game is wary and any incautious
rattle of oars would send them beyond reach. For
half an hour we put up with the discomfort, then
find that the boat is leaking badly and that a baler
has to be used freely to keep the floors from floating.
We ask to be put ashore!</p>
<p>On the road, walking is less difficult than we had
imagined. At one place is quite a hundred yards of
wind-swept path, but at a gateway the soft snow is
piled deep. It is hard work passing even occasional
drifts where you wade waist-deep for yards. At places
the road between cliff and lake is so blocked that we
climb along the open hillside. Now from an outstanding
crag above the road we have a view of the
lake and its surroundings. The water lies in a huge
trough, bounded by immense walls of mountain, hardly
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
ever falling far enough back to allow an alluvial
meadow to slip between. Mellbreak! What a mighty
mass! White are the wide fans of scree, but black
and frowning the tiers of precipice. Above in a grand
sweep comes the head of the mighty monarch, from
which the sunshine is striking a thousand frost spangles.
The sky is deep blue overhead. Hark to the croaking
of the ravens; they seem to have found some carrion&mdash;perhaps
a dead sheep&mdash;in yonder ghyll, and down they
come, one, two, three, in all six, a crowd for these
unsociable birds. Some of the ghylls are choked with
snow, but others show black, rocky rents in the snowfields.
Particularly I look for the great ravine down
which comes Scale Force, the highest of our waterfalls.
Once I climbed that gorge on a moonlit night in winter.
Never to be forgotten that scene! An opal sky
streaming with faint beams of aurora, tall crags closing
the chasms, the fern-like alders limned against the
starry glow above, the water rolling in pearly waves
over the rock-edge toward me, then falling through an
unseen zone to trouble the darkling pool at my feet.</p>
<p>Part of our homeward route lies through woodlands,
where we watch a busy squirrel visiting its <i>cache</i> of
nuts, and where, among the snow-laden branches,
scores of little birds flit and twitter. Once we hear
a buzzard mewing high above, and a sparrow-hawk&rsquo;s
raucous voice, but neither bird is seen.</p>
<p>Crummock in midsummer is a dream of delight.
Once lately, on a warm summer evening, I cycled up
its shore from Scale Hill. The road is rather gritty
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
and loose of surface, but quite ridable. The sun was
dipping toward the mountain ridges, pouring a flood
of glorious light into the valley. From the lake came
the chunk-unk of oars; two heavy-laden boats were
being pulled toward the foot of the lake, and soon
a clear young voice rippled across the water to us
the charming strains of &ldquo;Killarney.&rdquo; What a sublime
scene! Lofty Mellbreak sheering from the water&rsquo;s edge,
Grassmoor and many another craggy giant sweeping
up to invisible heights above us, the golden green of
new bracken, the purple bloom of heather, here and
there an emerald patch of larches. To me there is
infinite change in a view over a wide lake. Those huge,
irregular phantoms are the shadows of a cloud above:
they sweep across the lake, then dull the mountainside;
drop away into some deep glen, pass on to
dim far-away summits ere they slide over the
horizon. The emotions of the heavens are reflected in
God&rsquo;s mirror beneath. Should a thunderstorm gather,
then the lake is cast in gloom, sable ripples heave and
fall. To the roaring of heaven&rsquo;s artillery and the
blinding flare of lightning, the fury approaches, passes,
and the water wimples and rejoices in the falling curtains
of rain. After storm, how noble and sweet that restful
bosom! With fresh sunlight the land renews life and
hope. The down-bent harebell rises again to dance in
the gentle airs that play about; the heather casts off
its gleaming pearls&mdash;down the sinewy fronds of bracken
runs a tribute to the thin soil. Birds burst forth in
wild chorus: the throstle and the blackbird make the
rowaned ghylls resound; wagtails, wrens, linnets, each
pipe their tuneful parts. To these from on high
joins in the ringing of the skylark&mdash;a wild song of
defiance to the storm, of thanks for coming calm to the
Most High. And the lake, ruffled with passing breezes,
seems to rejoice as well. There is a fragrance of
earth and air and land after a summer storm on
Crummock Water.</p>

<p>Away across the lake, by the bouldery ness the torrent
of Scale has driven into the mere, are two islets, and
from one a smudge of smoke is travelling lazily. What
more delightful than to have a foretaste of the joy of
picnicing there? The road now inclines from the
water, and we climb toward the village of Buttermere
where a new series of views awaits.</p>
<p>Perhaps fewer people live by Crummock than by any
other lake: the fells hem it in too closely for farms
to be settled. There is much shepherding on the
commons, where flocks wander unchecked over wide
areas. It was in a scene similar to this that a touring
Devonian ventured to tell his Cumberland host that
he did not think much of this sort of country, for,
he explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down in Devonshire we have land, we can grow
apples, and we have green meadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Div ye mean ther&rsquo;s nae land here?&rdquo; said the
Cumbrian, sweeping his hand toward jagged crag,
sleeping lake, and boulder-strewn field. &ldquo;Why, man,
ther&rsquo;s that mich land here that it hes to be piled
togither, one farm on top o&rsquo; t&rsquo;other. Why, man,
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
ther&rsquo;s eneu&rsquo; land to mak&rsquo; fifty farms i&rsquo; Benkle Crag
theer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; assented the Devonian grimly, &ldquo;and
enough waste water to till the lot there,&rdquo; pointing
to the shimmering lake.</p>
<p>The wild moorland above the lake is one of the
few remaining English breeding-places of the dotterel.
This is a migrant of the plover type from high
latitudes; odd pairs are apt to stay all summer, and
to rear broods. The nest is increasingly rare: for
collectors will give long prices for a complete clutch
of eggs, and the native shoots the bird on sight, for
no more successful lure for trout exists than a fly
made from the underwing of a dotterel. I have
declined &pound;5 offered to disclose the whereabouts of
a nest. Once I undertook to show a naturalist a
nest, but though I had marked the place ever so
carefully I failed to give him &ldquo;the sight of a lifetime.&rdquo;
There are great difficulties in the way of a non-resident
again finding, in a maze of benks and boulders, ghylls
and riggings, so small an object as a dotterel&rsquo;s nest.
Other summer birds of the mountains are the ring-ouzel,
a white-throated blackbird, the peregrine, the
kestrel, and the sparrow-hawk. The bittern no longer
booms in the upper glens or by the lake; hen-harriers
and their kindred are also gone. But the wailing of
the curlew still rings in our ears, the plover is never
at rest, and the sinister &ldquo;dowk&rdquo; or carrion crow
gorges on every dead carcase on the uplands. Of
lesser birds, by every rill you see the pretty dipper
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
in his uniform of brown and white, and less often
the bright metallic sheen of the kingfisher. Winter
brings the fieldfare and redwing to the mountain
valleys, with now and then a flock of snow buntings.
On the lake too come the pochard and the golden
eyed ducks from the frozen North, with rarer species
such as the sheldrake, the wigeon, and the shoveller.</p>

<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small"><i>BUTTERMERE</i></span></h2>
<p>Buttermere is Crummock&rsquo;s sister-lake,
divided only by half a mile of level, swampish
meadows. Doubtless, in early ages, the twain formed
one long water, reaching from the foot of Fleetwith
eight miles to the hill at Scale. In size the upper lake
is much the smaller: even more than Crummock it
is a mountain mere. The fells rising from its shores
are among the lofty ones of the Lake Country: Red
Pike and High Stile with their back views into
Ennerdale, Robinson and Hindscarth facing the vale
of Derwent and far-away Skiddaw, and Brandreth
hiding behind Fleetwith. Buttermere is a solitary
place: the presence of the hamlet, the sheep-farms,
the small, dark woodlands, and the one mansion on
a head driven out by the activities of a fell beck, almost
accentuate its loneliness, for the bare pikes of mountain
dwarf them almost away. It is the coach-road which
brings the idea of modern life and relationships here.
It runs close to the lake, and every day in summer
and autumn a procession of vehicles passes along just
before the luncheon hour. From Keswick they have
started&mdash;coach, char-a-banc, wagonette, or more lordly
landau, wheeled into lovely Borrowdale to the merry
crack of the whip and gleesome blast of horn;
with a long pull, they have been hauled up steep
Honister Hause, with a brake-wrenching plunge they
have safely negotiated the narrow shingle-shelf called
a road. Timorous passengers have shrunk in terror as
they gazed at awful depths below, but now all nerves
compose themselves as the hooves rattle on the hard,
undulating road by the lake-side. After a suitable rest
the horses will draw the crowd away over Newlands
Hause, where out of the green hillsides a road has
been delved, to Keswick, and our dale and lake will
forget disturbance till to-morrow. The eternal silence
of a mountain-land will fall around and render
rapturous evening and night and blithesome morning.
To drive from Keswick to Buttermere and return is
no mean item in a tourist&rsquo;s day; it is a noble day&rsquo;s
work for horses, and only good ones can endure
frequent journeys over these rugged passes. Even
the &ldquo;easier&rdquo; slope of Honister is sufficient to &ldquo;break
many a horse&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The villaget of Buttermere was apparently unknown
to Roman, Saxon, and the building tribes of old; its
only historic building is the lowly public-house where
the Maid of Buttermere dwelt. Mary was the belle of
the glen in good King George&rsquo;s day&mdash;a blithesome
Cumberland lass, bonny enough to charm a yeoman&rsquo;s
eye, wealthy enough in a modest way to bring his
love and hand. But she was not for the dalesmen or
the shepherds of the mountains. Her fate was ripe
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
when one day a post-chaise brought to the little inn
a grand gentleman from Keswick. His dress was fine,
his looks noble, he had plenty of money. He gave
himself out to be Colonel Hopetown, son of a peer and
otherwise highly connected. Soon the guest condescended
to woo the Beauty, and ere a short summer passed they
were married. A few weeks later the &ldquo;colonel&rdquo; was
arrested on a charge of forgery&mdash;&ldquo;franking&rdquo; letters with
his &ldquo;relative&rsquo;s&rdquo; name to pass the Post Office&mdash;and was
proved to be the son of menial parents. Many other
and viler frauds had he practised after leaving the South
Country, but these he was never called to book for
on this earth. Forgery was a crime involving death
under the merciless penal code of those days, and the
impostor duly suffered at Carlisle. Mary of Buttermere,
so forcibly parted from her husband, did not
repine him long, but married a neighbouring farmer
and lived to a good old age. The small chapelry of
Buttermere was, some time previous to the happenings
mentioned, held by one of Wordsworth&rsquo;s heroes,
&ldquo;Wonderful Walker,&rdquo; the curate of Duddonside
Seathwaite, whose life-story of labour and frugality was
once so well known and esteemed. How he lived
several years in his office here is almost a &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; in
itself, for Buttermere allowed its priest no more than
&ldquo;whittle-gate&rdquo; and twenty shillings yearly. (Some
accounts aver that the remuneration was &ldquo;clog-shoes,
harden-sark, whittle-gate, and guse-gate&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a pair
of shoes clogged or iron-shod, a coarse shirt once
a year, free living at each parishioner&rsquo;s house for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
certain number of days, and the right to pasture a
goose or geese on the common.) Either scale would
not be too luxurious for even a successor of the
Apostles, bound to forswear the lusts of the flesh and
the pride of life. The person who held Newlands
chapel in the time of George II. was a tailor, a clogger
and butterpat maker, and the Mungrisdale priest had
&pound;6 0<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a year. Such cures were often held by
unordained persons&mdash;hedge-parsons with a vengeance.</p>
<p>The day I first came to Buttermere forms one of my
fairest memories. Starting before midnight on the
opposite edge of Lakeland, at daybreak I stood on
Dunmail raise; by breakfast-time I reached Keswick;
then I went up Skiddaw by way of Latrigg, descending
by the same route&mdash;the only one I then knew of on
that shoulder of the mountain; at noon I was on
Newlands Hause, plodding on cheerily. Hot and
grimed with dust, my eyes bleared with sweat and
the glare, I wonder if I looked so disreputable, so
much of a tramp, as I felt. A stripling of seventeen,
not stoutly built, poor in dress and pocket (I left home
with 1<i>s.</i> 9&frac12;<i>d.</i> and returned with but 3<i>d.</i> less), carrying
on my back a satchel with food for my day, to be
eaten in the open air and washed down with water;
there would be little jauntiness of face or body or
stride, I trow, after that forty-eight miles&rsquo; tramp. And
this was not the end of the journey. Buttermere
was only the Mecca, the turning-point, of my walk;
after passing it I turned up rugged Honister for
Borrowdale, and then by the Stake pass to Langdale,
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
and so home. Perhaps it were unmannerly to boast,
but eighty-five miles of road, mountain, glen, and pass,
in twenty-five and a half hours, is not a feat of my
every-day. As I entered the valley that day the clouds
closed down, shutting off the beating sunrays and
throwing a light, refreshing shower. Like the mountain
daisies, the wanderer for a full minute raised a rejoicing
face to the cooling raindrops. Then, like the sky, he
felt a trouble. &ldquo;Nay, nay, it&rsquo;s nobbut cestin&rsquo; a shooer,&rdquo;
said an aged shepherd, and my heart was comforted.
Not long before I had walked thirty miles through
pouring rain, and found it no light matter. Like a soft
slab of slate the lake stretched from the fringe of treetops
before to the stony, scrubby hillside opposite. Save
where coots and water-hens played by the sedges and
rooty river-mouths, the surface was calm, the light rain
merged into the water without splash or circle. The
hillsides round Buttermere are furrowed into ravines,
dark and gaping they split the festive green swathes
of summer-tide. And down these hollows dash lively
rivulets playing hide-and-seek, mazily threading through
shadow of alder and rowan, by groves of flowering
hawthorns, now lost in the depths of a ghyll,
now spouting in lively haste over a ledge curtained
with fern and bracken.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig44">

<p class="caption">HONISTER PASS AND BUTTERMERE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>It is a rare pleasure to be at Buttermere after
a series of rain-storms. From the rockrib wherefrom
the church commands its little flock, you look
into a great amphitheatre of crag-set mountains. Beneath
the eye is the water; it seems to be palpitating
with movement from the rich riot its tributaries are
hurling down the steeps. See how it wimples beneath
the farther shore&mdash;through a wide rent in the lake-bed
untold gallons of water are being forced upward
from the heart of the earth; that flat circle in mid-lake
against which the creeping catspaw of wind in
vain forces its feeble ripples shows another fountain
swelling up in quiet power. The steep hillsides are
seamed with threads of white; Sour Milk ghyll, in
a shimmering veil, sways from skyline to lake-shore.
Where often a hermit stream hides and glides behind
crest of rock, beneath screen of bracken, now is all
tearing, jumping, spreading fosse. Every fold in the
hillside casts down its bounding cascade; there is
nothing in the air so loud as this turmoil of waters,
this joy-song of deeps bursting from dark prisons
in bog and crag. Already, we are warned, the paths
to Wastdale and Ennerdale are impassable; the floods
are out at Gatescarth. Climbing would be a questionable
pleasure to-day; &ldquo;beck-dodging&rdquo; is far more suitable.
At first our road is dry, washed free from dust by the
heavy rain; through wide culverts the floods rumble
beneath. The wider becks are bridged: look up this
tree-hung gullet and see how the waters wilder down.
Not in waves do they come, but in great gush after
great gush, green and white. How they crash against
unseen rocks, throwing feathers of spray at every
shock, till the stream shooting beneath the arch seems
but a flying mass of airy, tortured foam! There
comes the sprite, the winged spirit of the day, robed
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
in brown and white&mdash;the dipper, our mountain water-crow.
How it chirrups and revels in the tumult! how
it flirts its tiny wings and dives through some curling
gout of spray! how it scolds the volume roaring
through the darkened tunnel beneath the road, causing
it, O highly important fairy, to flight up like a mere
blackbird, among the dripping plumes of larch!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat ahoy!&rdquo; we shout anon, and our friend afloat
a field&rsquo;s breadth away waves answer; in a minute the
boat is grinding the gravel, and we are almost down
the soaking field to reach it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, tired of fishing?&rdquo; we ask. He is a desperate
keen one with the rod as a rule, yet his tackle is
packed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he grumbles, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t catch anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I did think to-day would suit you. Good
spates in the becks, a light breeze, and plenty of cool
clouds,&rdquo; I marvel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; protested the angler wearily, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
no good talking like that. The floor of this lake is
leaking upwards as though the steam was escaping
by a thousand cracks in the ceiling of the nether
regions and being condensed into Buttermere. Why,
man, the lake bottom&rsquo;s that lively that the trout and
the char, the big pike down to the tiny minnow, are all
having a job to hold the water at all. I bet every
minute they&rsquo;re expecting a geyser that&rsquo;ll blow the
whole lot of &rsquo;em over Red Pike to Ennerdale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When an angler relapses into this mood he is
hopeless to cheer, so we silently respect his sorrows.
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
Perhaps into that vigorous pulling he will throw some
of his despondency. Now Fleetwith, flanked by the
precipice of Honister, is frowning at us over the
low fields. To the right, against a background of
watery clouds, is limned rugged Scarf Gap; the path
to it is white with rushing waters. The rocks everywhere
glimmer with oozing springs: down Honister
pass a wide torrent is foaming, attracting to it many
a milky force from Robinson and Fleetwith-side. The
scraggy stone-pines by the lake-head give a characteristic
finish to this scene of sodden brae and spouting rill.
Save for the sycamores round the farm of Gatesgarth,
there is hardly a tree for shelter; the aspect is bleak
and storm-riven. The boat is run on to the shingles
beneath the Scotch firs that we may land. Not far
away is the main road; we pass up the hillside beyond
it. In the recess beneath Fleetwith we are conscious
of a flood indeed. Much of the stony level is swamped;
with difficulty the sheep have been brought from
danger, and are flocked near the farmstead. The
torrents rushing in at the head of the mere can be
traced, first by white horses, then by dark, level-flowing
currents, far down the lake. From this height we
again feel that the great water is rocking in its cradle
of mountains. The furrows of incoming rills give the
peculiar idea of ever-changing level to the water.
I have never yet seen the whole level to Scale under
water&mdash;one lake of eight miles instead of two smaller
ones&mdash;but viewed from these heights it must be a noble
sight indeed. Our boat pushed into the in-dashing
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
beck, rapidly rides to halfway down the lake, thence
by carefully avoiding unfavourable currents we easily
make our landing-place.</p>
<p>To my mind, the valley is hardly less interesting
when a thick winter mist glooms it, when, for all you
can see, there is no difference between Honister top,
the crest of Robinson, and the stony fields round
Gatescarth. Under such circumstances it is well to
be afloat an hour, and allow impressions to establish
themselves in your mind. Twenty yards out you lose
the land: the boat glides along in a grey circle of
moving fogbeards and rippling waters. Save for the
sounds from bow and rowlock you are in a dead
silence. Shortly, however, the ear catches faint echoes:
the croak of the raven, the skirl of the curlew, ranging
in clear upper air, with now and then the attenuated
bleat or low or crow from the farmlands. In mid-lake
there are few sounds of water-birds, though at an
odd time a coot, traversing the width, may show,
a scared patch of brown and white, inside your zone
of vision. The lake-birds are cuttering softly close
inshore, finding the curtain of cloud an effective cloak
for feeding. An hour of boating thus, in gloom and
rowk, will form an experience not to be forgotten.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BORROWDALE YEWS
<br />Evening</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The fishing of Buttermere is now in a few hands:
sportsmen have leased the mere and devoted much
attention to its re-stocking. The result is that few
anglers outside this coterie come here, though on an
occasional day the mountain becks are worthy attention.
Most visitors here are active enough to relish rambles
over the fells, and there are many routes to select from.
Away from the narrow band of meadow-land touching
the lake, there are few obstacles to free-and-easy
wanderings. Sheep walks are divided by wire fences,
but these are fairly negotiable, by climbing over at the
&ldquo;posts&rdquo; or squeezing between the running strands
where slackest. Stout folks find the latter the preferable
method. To make the circuit of the glen of the
lake is a fairly big task, but it can be divided into
three moderate courses. You start by crossing the
meadows and climbing Scale Force brow, then, left-handed,
along Red Pike and High Stile (over bog and
bracken, across ghyll and up steep, with a glimpse
into Ennerdale here, a peep through Newlands at
Derwentdale there, and always the moor in sight,
with a clean, sweet breeze and, if the day be clear, a
wedge of blue sea on the horizon), finally descending
into Scarf Gap, the home of mists, where an
easy return path ends course one. From Scarf Gap,
into the back-o&rsquo;-beyont country behind Haystacks, and
to Brandreth with its legs into Buttermere, Ennerdale
and Borrowdale, always keeping to the right, and
ending the course over Fleetwith to Honister Hause.
From Brandreth it is easy to pass over Green Gable to
Great Gable, and so to gain Wastwater. Honister
pass-head is the scene of a legendary battle between
Britons and Picts, or between Angles and Scots&mdash;history
hardly decides which. One party had been a-foraying
in Borrowdale and hoped to withdraw over this pass
with their spoil; their pursuers, however, cut them
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
off and, after a wild resistance, recovered the cattle.
From Honister Hause&mdash;it is a wild place of rocks
and screes and untamable streams&mdash;the final stage
carries the wanderer over Dale Head to Hindscarth,
whence he descends by Robinson to Buttermere or to
Newlands Hause.</p>
<p>Every one walks up Honister as a matter of course.
What is it like on a bright July day, when the
beating heat is tempered by a smart breeze? Every
rambler should live with eyes open to nature; to-day
will repay him his interest. Up in the brilliant blue
ravens and hawks are hovering, crows and rooks are
ever passing over the glen. From one wood to
another the wild pigeon wings rapidly, the blackbirds
in the hedges are busy at their nestage duties. Take
note of the flowers, O man with seeing eyes. In the
pastures are great purple spikes of loose-strife, amid
the white waves of ox-eyes; round by the lake are
belts of blue lobelia. The air is full of the scent
of meadow-sweet, the honey-suckle here and there
throws trailers, adorned with creamy bloom, along the
hedges, and in great clusters blow the wild roses.
Up the shady beck-courses you might find the blue
forget-me-not and the still bluer birdlime, and in the
mossy springs the violet-shaped butterwort. Butterflies
and dragon-flies, softer moths and gaudy beetles,
are attracted by the multi-flavoured feast spread about.</p>
<p>Now we come to Gatescarth, the largest sheep-farm
within many a mile. A noted breeder of mountain
sheep lives here, one who has done much to improve
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
our semi-wild Herdwicks&mdash;much honour to him. The
farmlands, even in the glorious to-day, look harsh and
bare, though the soft, short sward is of the greenest.
In winter there is often severe stress here; at times
the shepherds are called upon to collect, in a day
of storm, the flocks from far-off crags and ghylls.
Long hours are spent battling the elements, collecting
the unwilling sheep, and bringing them down. The
wanderer here on a stormy winter night is not unlikely
to see a light patrolling far up the hillsides&mdash;one of
the belated shepherds patiently driving his sheep down
from the danger of flood and drift and gale. The
white cross which is attracting the eye, O inquirer,
is erected to the memory of a young lady accidentally
killed at that spot: &ldquo;In the midst of life we are
in death,&rdquo; is carved on it. The incident is one to
make every mountaineer pause and think. It was an
everyday risk, alas! The lady descending a steep
slope held her alpenstock straight in front of her;
the point struck the ground, but the lady slipped, her
chin caught on the butt of the stick and, such was
the force of the fall, her neck was dislocated, causing
immediate death. Such an accident is possible a score
times in every day&rsquo;s walk here. Now the great crag
of Honister is frowning by our very side. Around
its base the rambler will find broad tracts of alpine
ladies&rsquo; mantle, while forked spleenwort and many a rare
plant besides are among the screes and shelving rocks.
Among the grass and boulders near our path are long
fantastic growths of stagshorn moss, with more alpine
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
ladies&rsquo; mantle, with wild thyme, the precious eyebright
and yellow tormentil lifting their lovely heads in the
desolate wilderness. Now we reach the passhead:
Honister is the wildest of our passes, the place where
the great thews of Nature are least hid. But the slate
quarries make Honister less desirable to some eyes;
great confusions of debris, railroads sweeping up into
the bowels of the great crags; for nowadays men
do not work here, as they did in Wordsworth&rsquo;s time,
hanging down the cliff in frail basket-chairs tapping
and blasting the surface rock, nor do they carry
down the slate on handsledges as they did two score
years or so ago. The mining is more scientific&mdash;more
reliance is placed on machinery than on men. The
new railroad, carrying slates to Seatollar has improved
one thing at any rate&mdash;there is far less of that penetrating
screaming of brakes than when the loaded carts descended
the pass-road. On a calm day the racket could be
heard for miles.</p>

<br /><span class="small"><i>THE CHARMS OF DERWENTWATER</i></span></h2>
<p>Proud Cumberland ranks Derwentwater as queen
of the English Lakes; but I was born south of
Dunmail raise, and feel at liberty to worship at other
altars. To see the lake at its best one needs be
afoot long before the coaches and motors appear. A
road smothered in dust clouds, an atmosphere quivering
with clatter, the fumes of petrol and the general
unpleasantness of heavy traffic, detract from the most
imperious beauty. At daybreak the town is almost
silent: sweet mountain air has descended to dissipate
the closeness of midnight; the songs of larks and
throstles are wafted into the medley of houses and
streets from the fields and woods; the murmur of
flowing Greta is pleasant indeed. On Friars Crag
you may meet an early visitor, and at the landings
a boatman is cleaning up. As you stand there, in a
pleasant but undeniable way the waters call. &ldquo;A
boat, sir? Certainly. Will you wait till I&rsquo;ve finished
here?&rdquo; And you watch the man haste on his scrubbing
and polishing. In two minutes he scrambles on to
the pier, selects oars and cushions, sees you safe in
your place, and gives a push off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>As yet no other boat is astir: you have the wide
expanse to yourself. From Friars Crag scores of
people in the summer watch the sun set. And at the
close of a clear day the scene is glorious, even sublime.
Around a hundred peaks, ranging from noble Skiddaw
to humble Swineside and Catbells, the shafts of light
fall and ebb. Here in the rift between two summits
is a stretch of purple, there a patch of rosy light fades
on a scree-seamed brae. If the sun sets in a flurry
of crimson cloud the spectators will hardly take their
eyes from the lake: the reflections of the sky are so
charming, so magnificent. No painter could match
the evanescent changes, the kindlings of the sky, the
soft portrayal of each living flame on the shimmering
water, the green gloom of overhanging mountains.
What boots it if the fiery splendour is a presage of
rain when so splendid a pageant is the forecast? To
your left is rocky Derwent Isle. Fountains Abbey
held it, before the Dissolution of Monasteries, as Vicars
Isle; it has had half a dozen names since. Secluded,
a fringe of trees hiding its narrow lawn, a house
stands here which for sheer romantic situation would
be hard to beat in the Lake Country or wide
England. I would sit in an upper room there, on
a day of April squalls. First in the grey nor&rsquo;-east
I would see the storm clouds gather darkly behind
the cone of Skiddaw.</p>

<p class="caption">DERWENTWATER, FROM CASTLE HEAD
<br />A bright morning</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Derwentwater is lap-lapping merrily against the
stony beaches beyond the green sward, every wave
wearing a sunlit crown. The great hollows of the
mountain range are now filled with battling vapour;
from right and left round lower summits they move
to desperate attack&mdash;dun curls of skirmishers in front,
heavy phalanxes of infantry grey behind. Down the
air comes a whisper of riot and war, and with soundless
impact we see the two hordes meet, shock, and mingle.
Jagged as with unseen artillery, the battle sways from
end to end; then, like a bolt of Jove, over brawny
Skiddaw hurls a deluge of rain-sodden grey, the strife
ceases, a sharp, steady line of mists cuts off the seen
from the unseen. Now a grey shadow steals over the
land, the bubbling life is chilled from the waters, and
they rattle black and harsh against the cobble-stones.
But on Grange fell the russet bracken is bathed in
ephemeral sunshine. The shadow in the air grows
darker, the distance is obscured with the grime of rain.
The nearer hills, the fields, the town, are blotted out
ere the full fury of the squall shakes our window and
shrieks among the island trees. Like crest of cruelly
spurred horse, the waves toss high, the mad gusts
catch the rising gouts, wrench them clear into the air
and hustle them along to crash in resounding sheets far
up the shore. No boat was, we recollect with pleasure,
visible before the squall descended: it would go hard
with such a one just now. One experience of a squall
on a mountain lake is enough for the most daring.
I remember my baptism in such manner vividly. The
yacht had but one sail spread to the breeze, but maniac
Boreas caught it, pinned us down while water poured
into the well, wrenched and screamed and worried
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
at the mast and gear till that went overboard with
a crash, then, with a final paroxysm, spun the hulk
round and passed away over a waste of churning,
creaming waters. More comfortable to face the gale
with thin glass in front than to fare like that. The
trees bend like switches, but the gloom is now rising
from north-east. In a minute a flood of sunlight
is pouring down, waking to brilliance the flooded lawn,
and making sparkle the drop-decked boughs. Look
into the wake of the retiring storm. The lake is still
leaping white and racing along; a dim film hides
the crags above Grange: now it passes, so quickly
as almost to make one start at the rapid change.
It would be dowly living at Derwent Isle when fog
dark and drear hid lake and town: one might feel
lonesome when the blizzards whistled and fumbled
against window and door, and the waves crashed
without the snug retreat. But how joyous this
morning, when the sun is aloft and day has risen
refreshed from the bath of night and is newly beginning
a pageant of song and life and changing colour!</p>
<p>Further up the lake is Lord&rsquo;s Isle, where once lived
the Earls of Derwentwater. On the attainder and
execution of the last of the title the mansion fell
into ruins: some of its stone was used in building
Keswick market-hall. The last earl was much loved
in Cumberland; he was staunch to the Stuarts, as were
most Northern gentry, and intrigued widely to bring
about their return. When the first Pretender landed,
bringing such sorry allies and little promise beyond,
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
the earl foresaw that insurrection would be useless and
dangerous to the participants. He argued that,
although the Stuart was in Scotland, no rebellion need
be attempted in the North of England until the party
there were better prepared. In the secret council the
earl was held little better than a traitor; at home his
wife accused him of cowardice, demanding his sword
and horse that a Derwentwater, though a woman, might
take the accustomed place in the battle for King James.
The earl was no coward: he took the mocked sword
from his wife, and cast himself into the turmoil of
rebellion. It is history that the rising was crushed
with ease, and that as a ringleader the earl was
beheaded on Tower Hill. Powerful men at court
sued unavailingly for the young noble&rsquo;s pardon.
Money was lavished on the king&rsquo;s favourites in vain.
To raise funds the countess came north to the island-home;
the Cumbrians, incensed at her forcing the Earl
into the plot to save his honour at her hands, gave her
a chilly reception. Legend luridly asserts that her
horses were stolen while she was on the island, and that
she and her servants were threatened. At dead of
night a boat was rowed to near Lodore, where the
lady landed and escaped by way of the fells to Penrith
and the south. With her she carried a large quantity
of jewels, which were offered to save the young
husband&rsquo;s head. The ravine by which the countess
climbed to the open moors is pointed out as Lady&rsquo;s
Rake. If it were my province here to examine the
story in detail, I would find that it was hardly to
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
escape the Derwentwater tenants that the lady left
in such haste. She was, for her share in the late
rebellion, marked for arrest, or at least observation, by
the Hanoverian authorities.</p>
<p>Seven islands dot Derwentwater: on no other mere
are islands the feature we see here. Instead of snags
of rock sticking up from deep water, with trees
keeping precarious hold in clefts and crannies, these
are level, well-wooded places, standing behind ample
shallows.</p>
<p>Having passed Lord&rsquo;s Island, with its sorrowful
story of a life risked and lost for a banished prince,
Lodore is the next point. Every one knows by repute
Southey&rsquo;s <i>poem-de-force</i> describing the terrific rush
of its waters. After heavy rain the old poet&rsquo;s description
can be tested&mdash;at the expense of a wetting.
Down a wide stair from the moorland, bristling with
crags and boulders and outstanding seams, come the
waters&mdash;their frolic can often be heard at Keswick,
though Greta is charging, headlong, noisily down its
rugged course. The moment you enter the gully&mdash;should
you desire to see the heart of its beauty&mdash;you
are swathed in spray; never in flood-time can you
see more than a few yards ahead; your eyes film with
moisture; the air to your lungs is choky with mist;
the day is gloomed with spindrift. You see a white
front of water hurtling down from invisibility: it eddies
at your side, then drops away in gathering water-smoke.
Nothing can you hear at such a time but continuous
liquid thunder. Say the luxurious, there is then but
little to see except the watery path you are climbing?
Once I climbed this ravine at flood-time. As I passed
into the zone of water-smoke, there were blurred
visions of tumbling cascades, shadows of huge rocks
dimly seen across the ravine, dripping branches of
shrubs and plants among the streaming rocks. Then,
what a transformation! A flash of sunlight swept
into the hollow way. An atmosphere of shifting
jewels of rainbow hue above, around; strings and
clusters of pearls and diamonds dripping down reddish
crags veined and barred with gold and silver; grasses
poising delicate racemes of turquoise; mosses adorned
with tiaras of ethereal beauty, ruffles of ivory spray
caressing the currents of rich emerald. The brief glow
faded, and all became grey and black and dull green
again. For a glimpse of another such fairyland I
would face stress much wilder than greets one in the
gap of Lodore.</p>

<p class="caption">BY THE SHORES OF DERWENTWATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Another ravine in the cliff near by possesses a beautiful
waterfall, but Barrow Cascade is on private ground
and the free rambler can hardly be brought to see
it. The head of Derwentwater is so grown with
weed that a path has to be cut to allow boats to reach
Lodore landings. Near here the once wonderful
Floating Island anchors. A mat of vegetable fibre
lying on the lake-bed at times becomes inflated with
natural gas and rises to the surface. In 1864 a second
floating isle put in an appearance, and during that dry
summer it seemed likely that many acres of adjoining
lake-floor would follow suit. Floating Island shares
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
fell to tremendous discount and have never recovered.
The Derwent here enters the lake by two channels
through ooze and tangled water-grass. Few lakes
have so extensive shoals as Derwentwater: for acres
hereabout you may look over the boat&rsquo;s side through
some feet of clear, amber water at the growing reeds,
white spathes piercing the mud, green stems, and
hasty leaves unfolding ere they reach the upper air,
or thin waving threads linking a tuft of foliage on the
surface with unseen roots beneath; all kinds of pond-life
creeping and swimming about. Where the lake-bed
lies fallow the eye rests on soft levels of mud, with
a passing host of minnows, a red-necked perch, or
even a trout or pike. Here and there rock-spines
pierce the level floor, or perchance a bank of pebbles,
large and small, set in smooth mosaic, blood-red of
granite picked out with sea-blue slate, grey pebbles
of volcanic ash intermingled with knobs of salmon
sandstone, and conglomerate of every colour and shape.
Watch the sunlines creeping and chasing and quivering
as little ripples undulate the lake&rsquo;s surface.</p>

<p class="caption">GRANGE IN BORROWDALE
<br />Early morning</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>The narrow glen ahead is Borrowdale: its entrance
guarded by heathery Grange fell to left and by
Gate Crag to right, with Castle Crag uprising in the
centre as though jealous of an opening secret. A
century ago the world ended at Grange: hardy he
who toured into the sunset land beyond. The dalesmen
were simpletons&mdash;&ldquo;men of Gotham,&rdquo; who hardly
knew the use of wheels or saddlery. Castle Crag
presents a precipitous front; unknown hands have
fashioned earthworks on its crest. As the lake is not
low, the boat comes some way upstream towards
Grange. Here, when Borrowdale was its possession,
Furness Abbey had a barn for its harvests. Nothing
remains of it, however&mdash;possibly it was a mere skeleton
of wood which, when the Dissolution prevented the
harvesting of the monks, fell into ruin and was annexed
piecemeal by neighbours as required. Casual observers
have remarked, anent this penchant of our forefathers
in the Fell Country, that they took much trouble to
steal, carrying great distances timber they might have
felled at hand, stones which in bewildering profusion
lay upon their farmlands. Our forefathers knew the
toughness of the mountain oak and ash; to fell the
trees was simple, but no tools for shaping planks and
baulks were obtainable, while worked stone is still
worth carting far in the dales. Not every boulder
is fit for building stone, my kindly critic, and it is
hard northern sense which prevents the products of
labour lying fallow in grassy mounds.</p>
<p>Grange stands in one of the sweetest recesses of
Cumberland: the wide bed of Derwent furrows the
tiny level; in front and behind rise, pile on pile, the
rocky fells, dotted above with grey fleeces, below with
red and white and scanty black of milch cattle. I take
it a fine sight to sit by the bridge here and watch the
sun&rsquo;s last rays spread golden raiment on rugged Eel
crags and Maiden moor; down below a shadow of blue is
sweeping over intakes and screes, night hastening on ere
day has thought farewell. The boat now drifts back to
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
the lake, and passes along the Catbells shore. The
bays, with steep woods or brackened slopes rising out
of them, are all sweet and pretty, fit places for an afternoon&rsquo;s
quiet thought. This is the tip of an old lead
mine; the whole country-side is rich in unworked
minerals, from once-precious wad or plumbago (from
Borrowdale for years the chief supply of the world
was drawn) down to tin and copper. In the days of
Elizabeth a colony of German miners was imported
to improve the craft; several leading lake families are
descended in part from them. The foreigners were
not loved by the fell-landers, and for generations scarce
mingled with them. The success of a new process
has opened the mines at Church Coniston&mdash;will the
same occur here? In days when theological argument
was common, a Lake Country Quaker frequently encountered,
and sometimes worsted, a dignitary of the
Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may best me,&rdquo; said the cleric, &ldquo;but you do
not convince me yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; rejoined the other calmly, &ldquo;if but the
man was to convince, I could convince thee at once;
but what man&rsquo;s talk can pierce through that armour
of gold thou renewest yearly? Forget thy church
money, friend, for an hour, and I&rsquo;ll convince thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the mines are opened and our lakes and rivers
made pools and streams of mud, the glory of our
hillsides wasted with metal-fumes, the pen of the
writer will avail little against the chant of profit. The
large island now at hand is St. Herbert&rsquo;s&mdash;the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
renowned of all. In the early days of Christianity, an
acolyte of Holy Isle, off Northumbria, came here to
spend his life in divine contemplation and communion.</p>
<p>The story of Herbert&rsquo;s death forms our prettiest
unassailed legend. Once a year the hermit left his
island-cell and made a journey to his beloved Cuthbert,
who remained on Holy Isle. Age did not prevent
their tryst; and when eternal rest was nigh, the
venerable Christians each prayed that his departure
should not cause his friend to grieve. That petition,
says Bede, was granted.</p>
<p>One afternoon Cuthbert, surrounded by students of
God&rsquo;s Word, suddenly ceased the lesson he was expounding;
his aged face took on a joyous smile, and
in a moment he was dead. A messenger set out to
carry the mournful news to Derwentdale, but on the
way he met one hurrying to tell Cuthbert that on a
certain day his beloved friend had passed away. At the
same hour they both had entered the portals of death.
Centuries after Herbert&rsquo;s death his memory drew
pilgrims here from distant parts: at Portinscale dwelt
a smith who sold the image of the saint in silver-alloy
and lead. Some years ago his mould and fragments of
his wares were dug up near an old landing convenient
to the island.</p>
<p>There is no recognised ruin on St. Herbert&rsquo;s
Isle; the few worked stones scattered about may be
remains of the chapel built during the pilgrimages.
It was for long the custom of the good folks of
Keswick to celebrate St. Herbert&rsquo;s day by a procession
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
of boats up to the island and a service in the open
air to his memory. Opposite St. Herbert&rsquo;s Isle is
a belt of land touching the lake beneath and the open
commons of Catbells above, now secured as a public
pleasure-ground for ever. In this is Keswick blessed
above all Lakeland towns. The striking of eight
o&rsquo;clock from some campanile in the town brings back
the mind to prosaic human necessity. My back bends
to the oars and quickly the boat comes to rest in the
reflections of Friar&rsquo;s Crag. For a modest fee indeed
I have had three hours of Derwentwater at its best.</p>
<p>Another good way to see the beauties of the valley
is to walk or cycle round. The road takes you to
Crosthwaite church and over the meadows to Portinscale,
then winds into the glen of Newlands. But just
within, the way turns sharply, climbing up a corner of
Catbells, running in a long slope down to Grange,
Lodore, and so to the town again. Skiddaw, rather
than Derwentwater, is the most prominent object as
we leave Keswick northward. Just at present that
mountain is empurpled with heather, its great flanks
vivid with bloom and with the lighter green of bracken
fronds. Latrigg, the fell nearest at hand, has been
planted with larches; not so many years ago it was
treeless as Skiddaw and as beautiful. Not far from
the road is the home of Southey, poet and gentleman.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig50">

<p class="caption">CROSTHWAITE CHURCH, KESWICK</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Crosthwaite church has been subject of many pens.
The history of the present building goes back beyond
the great Reformation. Somewhere near this point
St. Kentigern of Strathclyde raised the cross when
banished from his native court. The present building
is doubtless the last of several which have successively
weathered the storms of fourteen hundred years.
Probably the first were built of willow wands and
clay, like the daub huts still to be found in remoter
Cumbria. With the Saxon still stronger in the land
a house of timber would be raised. Foundations
under the present building show an earlier stone edifice
probably built just before the Norman Conquest, which
in this stubborn region was not accomplished till
almost two centuries after the fight at Senlac. The
church stands out among the meadows, and in times
of flood is sometimes cut off from its congregation.
More than once within the recent past service has
had to be suspended on account of rising waters.
Present-day congregations may possibly be easily
daunted, but I wonder how the friars of old used
to manage when Derwent swelled across the meadows!
The monks&rsquo; road was some feet below dale-level,
and probably ran like a millrace. Did the old monks
hold service in the belfry? Did they in a body shirk
attendance at church, or was a boat hired to take down
the votary whose turn it was to conduct worship,
and the rest remain at home? We cannot tell now;
but had the ancient records mentioned these things
instead of others much less interesting to us, their
study would attract more attention. Inside the church
at Crosthwaite, apart from points of architecture valuable
to those who understand, most striking is the
effigy of Southey, done in white marble by Lough, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
self-taught sculptor from Northumbria. The lines on
it are by William Wordsworth. After the monument
was in its place, the poet felt this tribute not sufficient
for his dead friend&rsquo;s merits: accordingly he rewrote
some of the lines in loftier terms and had part of the
tablet newly engraved. This too, remember, by that
poet whom his contemporaries asserted to be without
sympathy for the feelings of others!</p>
<p>Outside the church in the graveyard looking towards
Skiddaw&rsquo;s triple crown, is the grave of Southey: a
plain stone tomb, with no highsounding phrases&mdash;fit
memorial of him who found the name of poet linked
with that of drunkard and libertine, and who exalted
it in himself and his school of thought to glorious
equality with that of gentleman. There is a font of
great age in the church, and effigies and memorials
of the Ratcliffe family, extinct with the last Earl of
Derwentwater. Beyond the church the road passes
between flowery meadows, across slow-flowing Derwent,
and on through Portinscale the magnificent, with a
glimpse of Derwentwater across its levels, and of course
a succession of views of Skiddaw&rsquo;s everchanging breast.
Once there is a vision of Bassenthwaite, but greenery
hides it almost as soon as seen. A turning here
might carry one miles from sight and sound of
twentieth-century life.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>For a mile Swineside is fringed&mdash;a common whereon
not long ago half-wild pigs were pastured; then
we hover by the vale of Newlands with its splendid
background of mountains. The road sways undecidedly
on the watershed: through a tangle of treetops
we see farms below; along a far-off hillside are the
ruins of a long flume down which water was conducted
to drive that tall waterwheel. The skeleton remains,
a blur on the pastoral beauty, though watercourse
and mine buildings are in indistinguishable ruin. At
last, the road throws a branch between banks of
meadow-sweet down to rattling Newlands beck; our
way sweeps toward cone-fronted Catbells. Shortly we
descend into a narrow glen, then zigzag up the flank
of the fell. After a hard pull (the day is hot; the
distant hills are swinging in vapour) we come to easier
angles. The road is delved out of the hillside, the
home of bracken and creeping stagshorn, with, by rills
almost silent with drought, trees of hawthorn, alder
and rowan. Below us&mdash;over spears of larch, over
<i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of oak and ash and birch, over green
and bronze cupolas of sycamore and beech, is the
vale of Derwent, from Lodore to the furthest Man
of Skiddaw. How sweet and dreamy the blue stretch
of water, dappled with shades of high-floating clouds,
with emerald islets scattered in bay and reach, with
the swift launches and the slow march of oared craft
glinting back the sunlight at the dip of every blade!
To northward lush fields and verdant woodlands border
the mere, with hillsides, soft green and swelling among
the levels, but, opposite, sheer and bristling with crags
they rise from the water, crowded in by the heathy
moors. Then the town on a tousled plain between
Derwent and Greta, and beyond, the hills giving place
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
to mountains, Blencathra and Helvellyn, shadows
wavering in August&rsquo;s blue sky. From this corner of
Catbells you curve slowly down to Grange; the road
is ever fair, but he is an ardent cyclist who prefers
to ride all along this incline of beauty.</p>
<p>From Grange it is easy to pass up to the jaws
of Borrowdale, in autumn one of the best pictures
of Lakeland, when the birches&rsquo; silvern bark is half seen,
half hid in the thinning leafage; the river is flooding
down too, not hiding in pools and filtering under
long stretches of white pebbles. Of course you see
the Bowder Stone if it is your first visit. It is by
a quarry quite close to the foot of Castle Crag.</p>
<p>One can reach Watendlath by a mountain track
from Rosthwaite. This is a shallow dip in the moorland,
containing a pretty tarn and one or two small
farms. Not many years ago a Cumbrian visitor put
the following note in his diary: &ldquo;I came to a village
called Watendlath, the most primitive place I ever
saw in Cumberland. I entered one of the houses.
There was no fireplace, but only logs of wood and
turf burning on the floor.&rdquo; Not here, but still within
the Lake Country, I stumbled upon a similar thing.
My queries aroused the ancient dame&rsquo;s curiosity.
&ldquo;You divvent mean to tell me you&rsquo;ve nivver seen a
hearth fire afore? Well, well.&rdquo; I was eager to know
how, minus an oven, she baked bread. The old
eyes sparkled with amusement. &ldquo;Why, I make it
in t&rsquo; pan ower t&rsquo; fire.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t see the process, but
I tested the quality of the product, which was excellent.
A century ago ovens were rare in the dales; on
baking day the dough was placed in a covered pan,
which was laid on the hearth. Fuel was then heaped
around and on top of the pan. When sufficient time
had elapsed the housewife raked aside the burning
embers, opened the pan and took out the baked batch.
Had it been possible for any wandering reader to
witness the bakery, I would have told the place; but
five years after my discovery, wishing to see again
the old-time oven, I visited the dale. Alas! the cottage
was empty, falling into ruins, and a green mound in
the church garth covered my aged dame. The tarn
of Watendlath is fed mainly by a stream which comes
down the desolate back of Armboth fells, passing
through Blea tarn on its way. This beck it is that
goes down the thunder-chasm of Lodore. It is an
interesting ramble, giving some splendid views of
Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite, down to the Keswick
road, by Ashness bridge.</p>

<p>But we are for Keswick, to recall briefly three scenes
in its market-place beneath the old tower. Imagine,
if you can, crowds of soberly dressed people passing in
and out of this space&mdash;Convention week! How the
dark clothes appal you as day after day passes!
The streets have the air of devotion, but behind
the houses the lanes teem with business. Another
scene: the same streets are crowded, but the throng
is of a wild gaiety&mdash;motley are the hues that press
in and out. Not the steady, respectable murmur of
conversation, but a wild medley of sounds, snatches of
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
song, bursts of sound from uncouth unmusical
instruments, shouts and laughter and much merrymaking.
It is a bank holiday crowd, come to be
entertained at all hazards. Five hours ago the town
was peaceful as that morning when I rowed out on
Derwentwater; shortly the crowd will have diminished,
till by curfew-time many of the weary folks of
Keswick will cast down their tasks to breathe something
of evening&rsquo;s calm.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>My last scene is the dalesman&rsquo;s Keswick, as I
first saw it many a year ago. The square is
filled with moving sheep: it is the great October
fair day and a long flock is now passing toward
the narrow Borrowdale road. How the air quivers
to their plaints! and the grey walls echo the tumult&mdash;the
sharp barkings of busy dogs, and the loud
shoutings of the shepherds. We descend to where
the farm-wives sit with eggs and butter, and one
offers us barley-bread, that luxury now so seldom seen
and appreciated outside rural Cumbria. Or is it
home-made cheese we would buy? Tough as leather
and white as milk, &rsquo;tis true Willimer. Strong jaws
and patience enough has the man who can enjoy this.
Outside the narrow market are cartloads of potatoes
and turnips; further down a couple of loads of wheat
are for public auction. The congregation of buyers
and sellers is interesting: hard-featured dalesmen,
their ruddy wives and daughters, neater-dressed town-dwellers
bargaining with them. Here comes another
drove of sheep&mdash;judged by Southron standards they
are small, but their mutton is the sweetest to be had.
There is little &ldquo;silly sheep&rdquo; about them. Intelligent
faces, alert limbs, they have already learnt to sup
on heather-tops when the grass is buried in snow,
silently to endure the wild blizzards and the rainstorms,
to avoid swamp and torrent and crumbling edge of
cliff. In their train comes friend Jacob, from the
Bassenthwaite side of Skiddaw. All through this series
of descriptions I have wished to introduce one lake
as seen by those who dwell close to it. Bassenthwaite,
being out of the tourist route, offers excellently for
the experiment. Jacob&rsquo;s rich dialect would, however,
be difficult for those who know not the North Country,
and to give the literal English would be to destroy
the extreme raciness of the speech. Therefore, a
middle way is attempted, retaining where possible the
Cumbrian construction of phrase, and idiom.</p>

<br /><span class="small"><i>BASSENTHWAITE</i></span></h2>
<p>Jacob is wary and needs some management. First
we chat about the exceeding fine autumn passing.
&ldquo;Aye, it&rsquo;s fine, hooivver.&rdquo; Jacob is slow of
idea and of speech: no duty in his varied life ever
needs lightning thought or action; he is decisive
enough, but never precipitate. A typical dalesman&mdash;tall
and broad-shouldered, stooping somewhat. Until
you have walked a few miles by his side, you think
he is a slow plodder, but experience teaches much.
Without the slightest exertion he makes his four
miles in the hour, over smooth road, soft meadow,
or rocky hillside alike. As you see him face an ascent,
you marvel how a man so accustomed to the work should
have such an awkward style. But, defiant of all rules
of the climbing and walking cults, he works his way
up, down, or across the slopes with ease. Three hours
of his work on the mountain is enough to tire most
casual ramblers who know him. Once I worked a
long day collecting sheep with him, but the sense of
exhaustion was too severe to make me wish to proffer
help again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye&rsquo;d a summer on t&rsquo; fell ye&rsquo;d do varra weel,&rdquo;
was his comment as I wearied through supper afterwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye want me to tell ye&rsquo;r frend aboot Bassenthet?&rdquo;
he queries. &ldquo;Nay, nay, ther&rsquo;s nowt to tell. In
summer it&rsquo;s aw wark on t&rsquo; land, and in winter aw&rsquo;s
ter&rsquo;bl&rsquo; dree. Nay, ther&rsquo;s nowt at aw, man, as I can tell
ye on. I&rsquo;m net yan as talks mich. I&rsquo;s leev&rsquo;d aw
me life aboot Bassenthet, as did me father an&rsquo; gran&rsquo;-father
afoor me. It&rsquo;s nobbut a lile farm, but ther&rsquo;s
a fair bit o&rsquo; heaf-gang on Skiddaw. It gives us a
lock o&rsquo; wark in summer, like at clippin&rsquo; an&rsquo; weshin&rsquo;.
What&rsquo;s that, lad? Du I ivver gang tu laik? [My
friend has asked if Jacob ever goes to the lake, but
has been misheard.] Well, I&rsquo;s no bairn, I&rsquo;s leev&rsquo;d in
t&rsquo; reigns o&rsquo; three kings an&rsquo; a queen, but I deu like a bit
o&rsquo; spooart. You should come and hev a hunt wi&rsquo;
us. We hev grand runs noo an&rsquo; then. Mr. Crozier&rsquo;s
hoonds are rare uns. They&rsquo;ll chase a fox five er sex
times roond Skiddaw rayther &rsquo;n it sud git away.
John Crozier&rsquo;s dead noo; he was a grand un for
t&rsquo; daels [dales]&mdash;a good gentleman. Then ther&rsquo;s a
few hares [the Cumbrian pronunciation of this word
evades the science of print] in t&rsquo; boddems. But they&rsquo;re
nobbut babby-wark at best, fit for a day wi&rsquo; t&rsquo; sna
on t&rsquo; tops. We used to hev a bit o&rsquo; cockfeightin&rsquo;
yance ower, but t&rsquo; police er doon on it noo. But,
hooivver, we mannish [manage] a main noo an&rsquo; then
in spite on &rsquo;em a&rsquo;, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever do any fishing, Jacob?&rdquo; I asked&mdash;my friend
cannot get the old man from the fells to the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nut mich. T&rsquo; lads gropple us a fry when
t&rsquo; beck&rsquo;s lah [low], and on a wet day ther&rsquo;s a few to
gitten wi&rsquo; t&rsquo; worm. But I nivver caerd [cared] for
booats, and hevn&rsquo;t been across t&rsquo; lake in yan mair
en a duzzen times i&rsquo; me life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the lake in spring?&rdquo; asks
my companion. Jacob is not deaf, but the tongue
of a Southerner is as difficult to him as the accent
of a Frenchman might be. Again he mistakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther&rsquo;s a gradely many, ower many springs,&rdquo; he
grumbles. &ldquo;I think ef they&rsquo;d nobbut get to wark
an&rsquo; drain it ther&rsquo;d be some fairish land underneath
it. Mappen we woddent need to send oor sheep
away t&rsquo; winterin&rsquo;. It wod mak some bonny nice
pastur&rsquo;, eh? Mair like sensible than throwing [Cumbrian,
thrahin&rsquo;] brass away to mek gomerals o&rsquo; t&rsquo; bairns
an&rsquo; fine gentlemen o&rsquo; t&rsquo; skulemaisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gay bonny under Skiddaw in lambing-time,
isn&rsquo;t it, Jacob?&rdquo; I interpose. The ancient is puzzling
himself as to what my friend has meant; he is aware
that he has again misunderstood, and is, I am afraid,
becoming irritable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see mich to blaw aboot; there&rsquo;s wark enow
on t&rsquo; fell, an&rsquo; precious lile leet [light] for owt else.
Then yan hardly knas [knows] when it is spring.
Some days it&rsquo;s like midsummer, an&rsquo; then next day
it&rsquo;s cald enough to flay yan alive. Auld Michael
Fletcher, as leev&rsquo;d up at t&rsquo; Yeds, ewst [used] to say,
I mind him varra weel, when yan happened to eks
[ask] him aboot t&rsquo; wedder: &lsquo;Nay, bairn, I don&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
kna. Yance ower we used to hae it mak&rsquo; o&rsquo; decent,
rain an&rsquo; droot just as t&rsquo; land needed &rsquo;em. That
was when God A&rsquo;mighty hed t&rsquo; job o&rsquo; mannishin&rsquo;
[managing], but noo that them dashed Americans
hae gitten hod on&rsquo;t yan hardly knas what mak o&rsquo;
wedder we&rsquo;re gaen to hae t&rsquo; next.&rsquo; But t&rsquo; years er
better an&rsquo; warse wi&rsquo; us; this year t&rsquo; wedder was
middlin&rsquo; nicish, but I mind lots o&rsquo; times when it&rsquo;s
been aboot as bad as it weel could be. Ther was yan
year i&rsquo; particular. We hed aboon six hundred yows
[ewes] to leuk after, and when it com a girt sna-storm
ther was some dewins. We hed put a vast on &rsquo;em
on t&rsquo; heaf, an&rsquo; we hed to gang roond wi&rsquo; hay to &rsquo;em,
for t&rsquo; sna wur varra nar a yerd deep; t&rsquo; sheep hed
gitten into varra nar ivvery okard spot on t&rsquo; yall fell.
T&rsquo; sna was that thick as we hed to sled t&rsquo; hay, an&rsquo;
t&rsquo; drifts wer that deep as we couldn&rsquo;t hae t&rsquo; horses at aw
ower many a yakker [acre]. Ther was yan ginnel
where we hed some wark to git at t&rsquo; sheep at aw.
T&rsquo; top was blockt wi&rsquo; a fair wall o&rsquo; sna, an&rsquo; t&rsquo; top
o&rsquo; that hung ower like t&rsquo; thack on a stack. You
couldn&rsquo;t git doon at aw, an&rsquo; baeth sides wer as bad,
what wi&rsquo; girt steep crags an&rsquo; mair sna. We tried
to git intull &rsquo;t fra bela&rsquo;, but that was war then baeth o&rsquo;
t&rsquo; othern. Yan girt drift piled on t&rsquo; top on anudder.
I began to think it wur gaen to be a bad job till lile
Tommy Moffat, as hed leev&rsquo;d amang t&rsquo; fells, com up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why Jacob,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;tou mun git a raep

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what gud will a raep be tull &rsquo;em, tou Daft

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Noo, Jacob, it&rsquo;s thee as is Daft Watty. Send

<p>&ldquo;Well, when we gat aw t&rsquo; raeps he set three on

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Noo, Jacob, I&rsquo;s gaen ower t&rsquo; edge o&rsquo; t&rsquo; drift.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An sewer enough ower he went, an&rsquo; I clam along
t&rsquo; crags as far as I could to watch. I tell ye it wor
queer, he wor far enough frae me, to see him hingin&rsquo;
away by that bit o&rsquo; threead-like. But efter a bit he
gat on tull a foothod, and began to walk aboot t&rsquo; ghyll.
What he was efter I didn&rsquo;t see, but in a bit he come up

<p>&ldquo;Noo, I didn&rsquo;t caw him Daft Watty, but hooivver cud
he git them sheep up that brant o&rsquo; sna&rsquo; whar he couldn&rsquo;t
climm hissel? Hooivver ower he went as I said, an&rsquo;
I went ower t&rsquo; crags to watch. He hed his dog in his
arms as they lowered him doon, an&rsquo; he let it off that
minute he gat doon to t&rsquo; bottom&mdash;it was like lukkin
intull a well frae whar I was at. Tommy hed gone
reet doon to t&rsquo; end o&rsquo; t&rsquo; hooal, an&rsquo; began hoonden
t&rsquo; sheep up intull yan corner. Ther was a bit on a

It wasn&rsquo;t many minutes afoor I sah as t&rsquo; sheep hed

&lsquo;Noo, Jacob, wha&rsquo;s t&rsquo; Daft Watty?&rsquo; It wornt

<p>&ldquo;Tommy went back to Ennerdale t&rsquo; followen summer,

you said yance that you hed seen him in Ennerdale
last back-end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Yes, I had seen him, and found him overjoyed to
hear of his one-time chum on Bassenthwaite side.
These old-timers of the fell-heads are essentially men
of their own localities. A journey of ten miles would
bring them often into a terra incognita. The two
old men mentioned above had a sincere regard for
one another, yet it never occurred to them to traverse
the fifteen miles of mountain which lay between their
homes, nor to expend the three or four shillings
which by rail would have carried them almost to the
doorstep of each other. Perhaps such an incident as
the following deters them. One old man of my
acquaintance held a strong regard for another who
for half a century he had not seen&mdash;and the while
their domiciles were hardly ten miles apart. One day
after much consideration old John decided that the
time was ripe for a visit to old Billy, and off he set
by the low moor road, with a pocket full of provisions
to eat on the way. Two hours after he had got away,
a hale old chap entered the hamlet inquiring for him.
&ldquo;Old John?&rdquo; said I to the stranger. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s just
gone over the fell to see a friend in &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it to see Billy Longmire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Jack&rsquo;s just as daft as ivver. Here I&rsquo;ve
com be railyway to see him, an&rsquo; what mun he dew
but set off be rooad to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two veterans did not meet, for Billy would not
sacrifice the return half of his &ldquo;railyway&rdquo; ticket, and
Jack was so disgusted at the occurrence that he would
not await his friend&rsquo;s return. Though the pair lived
at least ten years longer, they never made another
attempt to meet.</p>

<p>But it is of Jacob that I should be speaking, and of
the day when in Keswick market-place I tried to lure
him on to description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a man like you will have met a few great
men in your time,&rdquo; suggested my friend in a halfhearted
manner. &ldquo;I mean did you ever see Southey,
or Wordsworth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say I ivver did. I hae often heard of
Mr. Southey, but he was often away in t&rsquo; Sooth. But
ther was yan chap I mind varra weel&mdash;t&rsquo; Skidda
Hermit we used to caw him. Whar he com fra we
nivver knew, but yan summer we began to find ther
was some body leeven in t&rsquo; huts on t&rsquo; fell as hed
nowt to do wi&rsquo; shipherds. But for many a day we
nivver cam across him. We fand him at last in
a ghyll penten&rsquo; a picter of a waterfa&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; a fine
picter it was hooivver. But he woddent speak tull
us. We thowt he was dumb and wanted him to tell
our fortens, but he was as sulky as could be. He
went off aw at yance leaven his painten and things
just as they wor, and for a week or two we didn&rsquo;t
see him again. He was a tall chap, nut varra dirty
seein&rsquo; how he leeved on t&rsquo; fell, and allus was fairly
put on. But though he gat as he wod talk tull sum
on us, he wod nivver say nowt about his name nor
whar he com frae&mdash;you hed just to mention that and he
was off like a deer and ye didn&rsquo;t see seet on him agaen
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
for many a day. He didn&rsquo;t stop on Skidda always,
but he was oftenest there&mdash;it is aboot t&rsquo; whietest
[quietest] place in England on t&rsquo; moor there. Then
yan back-end he went off; he gev me a bit of blue
cobble pented wi&rsquo; a grey sheep just afoor, but I lost
it on t&rsquo; fell&mdash;it was weel done&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, Jacob?&rdquo; through the bleats and barks
and whistles and shouts a voice interrupts; it is
one of our friend&rsquo;s neighbours prepared to go
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye. Good-day,&rdquo; this last to us, and he steps into
the trap.</p>
<p>Such is a Cumbrian&rsquo;s description of Bassenthwaite.
We went to hear about the lake, but alas! Jacob
hardly had a word to say about it. Next time I will
ask him about shepherd-life on Skiddaw and he will
probably reel off stories innumerable of the water in
summer and winter, and of the men who give to the
lake the attention due. Jacob is typical of his class,
and his reticence was not due to any wish to keep
information from us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small"><i>THIRLMERE FROM THE MAIN ROAD</i></span></h2>
<p>The fact that Thirlmere is the reservoir for the
drinking water of Manchester renders it somewhat
unapproachable. Main roads encircle the lake at
no great distance, but the whole watershed&mdash;Dunmail,
Helvellyn-side, and Armboth&mdash;has been purchased on
behalf of the city, and at hardly any point can one
reach the lake-shore without breaking some bylaw.
There is, I believe, only one boat allowed on its
surface, strictly for the surveyors responsible for the
embankment, etc. Though the lake was restocked
after its conversion and large trout are now fairly
plentiful, angling is hardly permitted.</p>
<p>The city of course has a perfect right to seclude
the lake if by so doing they prevent impurity in
its waters, and after all it is somewhat of a satisfaction
to feel that a few square miles of Lakeland are tolerably
certain of escaping the builder and the miner. The
mines of Helvellyn are now likely to remain closed for
our generation.</p>
<p>Old Thirlmere, like a winding river, connected a
series of wider pools; at its narrowest point, near
Armboth, it was spanned by stone bridges. Now,
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
by judicious embankment, its area has been doubled,
yet there still remains a very definite river-lake. I
think Thirlmere a place of beauty, though I do not
forget viewing, from mid-lake (this pleasure was
illicit, of course), those harsh lines through the trees
and along the hillsides behind which the new roads
are cunningly contrived. However, when you are
on Armboth road the disagreeable &ldquo;line&rdquo; does not
trouble; instead you admire a beautifully engineered
way through the mountains, giving entrancing glimpses
up narrow ghylls, vertical peeps into pretty bays, with
the grand contours of Helvellyn ever present either
through a film of leafage or more clearly between the
groups of trees.</p>
<p>Most of us see Thirlmere from the coach or from
our cycles. Though the scenery is so fair, there is
no escape from the wheeled procession. The quiet
retirement of the old bridle-road is vanished. From
Grasmere the head of the lake is about half a dozen
miles distant, to Keswick it is not much more than
four from its foot. From the former the approach
is up the pass of Dunmail.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/p56.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="756" />
<p class="caption">RAVEN CRAG, THIRLMERE</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>And this is the scene which meets the eye after
you have toiled up the long slope. Behind is the
bold and curious-shaped summit of Helm Crag, sage
Asphodel, the Witch crooning over her hell-kail. Far
off is Loughrigg fell with larch woods clustering up
its sides, and the lake of Grasmere so dull with green
reflections that a quick eye is necessary to distinguish
it from its surroundings. Rising from your side is
Seat Sandal, a host of carrion crows wheeling round
its rugged knots; Steel Fell rises opposite, flecked with
wandering sheep. The sky is bright blue, with soft
white clouds lazily drawing their way across the
narrow gulf. In wide patches the sunshine seems
to drift about the landscape, picking out a green benk
here, throwing a shadow over the crags there into some
deep ravine. The scene at the head of the pass is
of extreme wildness. The hillsides are scattered with
scree, the uneven bottoms with boulders of every
shape and size. The cairn of Dunmail, last king
of Pictish Cumbria slain in battle with Edgar the
Saxon, is here, a formless pile of stones. There is
a legend concerning this spot.</p>
<p>The crown of Dunmail was charmed, giving to its
wearer a succession in his kingdom. Therefore King
Edgar of the Saxons coveted it above all things.
When Dunmail came to the throne of the mountain-lands
a wizard in Gilsland Forest held a master-charm
to defeat the purpose of his crown. He Dunmail slew.
The magician was able to make himself invisible save
at cock crow, and to destroy him the hero braved
a cordon of wild wolves at night. At the first peep
o&rsquo; dawn he entered the cave where the wizard was
lying. Leaping to his feet the magician called out,
&ldquo;Where river runs north or south with the storm&rdquo;
ere Dunmail&rsquo;s sword silenced him for ever. The
story came to the ear of the Saxon, who after much
inquiry of his priests found that an incomplete curse,
though powerful against Dunmail, could scarcely harm
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
another holder of the crown. Spies were accordingly
sent into Cumbria to find where a battle could be
fought on land favourable to the magician&rsquo;s words.
On Dunmail raise, in times of storm even in unromantic
to-day, the torrent sets north or south in
capricious fashion. The spies found the place, found
also fell-land chiefs who were persuaded to become
secret allies of the Saxon. The campaign began.
Dunmail moved his army south to meet the invader,
and they joined battle on this pass. For long hours
the fight was with the Cumbrians; the Saxons were
driven down the hill again and again. As his foremost
tribes became exhausted, Dunmail retired and
called on his reserves&mdash;they were mainly the ones
favouring the Southern king. On they came, spreading
in well-armed lines from side to side of the hollow
way, but instead of opening to let the weary warriors
through they delivered an attack on them. Surprised,
the army reeled back, and their rear was attacked with
redoubled violence by the Saxons. The loyal ranks
were forced to stand back-to-back round their king;
assailed by superior masses they fell rapidly, and ere
long the brave chief was shot down by a traitor of
his own bodyguard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My crown,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;bear it away; never let
the Saxon flaunt it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig58">
<img src="images/p57.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="712" />
<p class="caption">THIRLMERE AND HELVELLYN</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>A few stalwarts took the charmed treasure from his
hands, and with a furious onslaught made the attackers
give way. Step by step they fought their way up
the ghyll of Dunmail&rsquo;s beck&mdash;broke through all
resistance on the open fell, and aided by a dense cloud
evaded their pursuers. Two hours later the faithful
few met by Grisedale tarn, and consigned the crown
to its depths&mdash;&ldquo;till Dunmail come again to lead us.&rdquo;
And every year the warriors come back, draw up the
charmed circlet from the depths of the wild mountain
tarn, and carry it with them over Seat Sandal to where
their king is sleeping his age-long sleep. They knock
with his spear on the topmost stone of the cairn, and
from its heart comes a voice, &ldquo;Not yet; not yet;
wait awhile, my warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road now turns down the pass, a long, swinging
slope where the steadying brake is necessary. To
northward show the storm-washed sides of Helvellyn,
with new rents staring like fresh-turned loam in the
sunshine. A blue peak of Skiddaw is holding, as
though unwilling to part with, a fleecy cloud, and
here sweep into sight Raven Crag with its precipitous
front, and the laughing summits of Armboth, one by
one. Our cycles are gaining speed; we reach a
corner, the top of a steep pitch,&mdash;there before us
is a sudden view of Thirlmere, with Saddleback rising
in rugged majesty behind. The open water is ruffled
with breezelets, but every sheltered cove shines level
blue. The pace becomes faster; the long curves
are turned at ever-increasing speed. On either side
are wide grass slopes, cut up by stony gullies. We are
still above the zone of trees, if we except the fringes
of rowan, the solitary hawthorns. Now across a bridge,
spanning a wilderness of rubble where after heavy rain
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
a flood roars and even throws veils of spray on to
the road. A straight descent, and below we view
the gardens and trees, white-walled inn, and grey
church at Wythburn. Now, instead of allowing the
machines full way to race in fifty seconds down the
half-mile incline, we approach more leisurely, for
halfway down the steep the road we are to take turns
off at a tangent. Out of a clump of tall sycamores
an old farm emerges; this is the Post Office, far
removed from neighbouring houses! To the right
Helvellyn is now in fuller sight, furrowed with
watercourses, jagged with scaurs, with the sunshine
dancing on the brackens and warming up the sober
green stretches of grass. The dale is desolate and
barren, yet a portion is known as the City, in memory
possibly of a settlement of Britons in its stony
waste.</p>
<p>The great gap of Wythburn Head will afford a
pleasant ramble to any one who has the time. There
is no towering crag, no huge cataract, no narrow,
yawning ravine, but an infinite variety of the sweetest
brook scenery. Only a few hundred yards from the
road is a small basin of water, entirely hedged by
slabs of stone, ten feet deep, and so clear that the
least pebble on the floor can be seen&mdash;a place scoured
by floods as clean of sand and soil as though Nature
were the most expert of housemaids. On the bottom,
in their season, the chrysalides of the Mayfly crawl&mdash;how
wonderfully protected they are by their stick-like
shape and their coats of sand! most realistically they
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
imitate a piece of rotting twig as they lie in a chink
of the pool-bed.</p>
<p>Another sweet corner I remember well. It is a
dream of beauties in miniature. The down-pouring
rivulet divides round a boulder, throwing two pearly
cascades into the gloomy pool a fathom below. Round
this pool the rocks rise sharply, crowned with foxgloves,
heath and bog-violet, with a single stem of
fly-orchis, with ivy and a cluster of the grass of
Parnassus; more ivy wreathes around the roots
of the trees, and long beards of moss drip with the
outpourings of secret springs. Overhead, the alder,
the rowan, and a few spindly self-grown ashes flourish,
with a bush of glorious wild roses wilting loose
petals into the slow-moving, bubbling circle. Ferns
cluster among the tree-stems and on haphazard ledges,
parsley and oak, the broad buckler and others, together
with hardy bracken and other ubiquitous plants of
the uplands. In a hole there a wren has built her
nest, a thrush homes in the thickest holly, while the
hawthorns are inhabited by a colony of hedge-sparrows
and titmice. It is an active corner in bird-life if
you have time to see it and your patience exceeds
that of the busy midges.</p>
<p>The road has a slight incline which carries the
cycle along with small exertion. The fences, as is
customary in tourist Lake Country, are partly wall,
topped with wire rail&mdash;a plan which allows the journeyer
by road fully to enjoy the scenery. Tall, moss-grown
walls and dense hedges are a feature of unfashionable
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
Lakeland, but, pretty as they undoubtedly are, they
sadly narrow the wanderer&rsquo;s vision. The lake is now
close by, stretching into the reedy level meadows. One
curious feature is a now useless bridge, raising its hog-back
in the mere. Wee looks the white-walled inn
across the glen, with the great mountain range almost
overhanging it. The fellside above us is bristling
with crags, some splintered and hanging as though
a breath of wind would hurl a shower of stone down
upon us; others rise in flawless tiers, grandly immovable,
impervious to the forces of Nature. And beneath
them is the dainty, dancing harebell, the jocund foxglove,
the sweet blooming heather, and many a starry
mountain flower. Few trees are in sight; round an
abandoned farm is a lonely cluster of sycamores; gulls
are screaming and paddling in what was once pasture-land.
Bare and stern is the last back-glance ere our
way curves into a passage cut through the rocks.
Then, suddenly&mdash;is this a new land, a new Thirlmere?
The transformation is sudden and complete. To northward,
many a mile, stretches a narrow lake, basking
in the afternoon sun. Dense coppice and green larches
clothe the slopes rising from the water; there is no
indication of farms, of humanity.</p>
<p>The lake is quite close, we gaze down a terrace
of rock at its shining mass. A knoll crowned with
tough, short oaks is almost cut out from the land;
a faint swell breaks entirely round a rock on which
heather is in bloom. In the bay some wild ducks
are feeding; Thirlmere in the quiet of winter is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
grand haunt of migrants from ice-covered Northern
seas. The lake is at its widest here; right opposite
is the sham castle which Manchester erected over the
pipe which draws, through ninety miles of mountain
and meadow, the waters of Thirlmere. It is a pretentious
battlemented horror of red sandstone at
present, an insult to the shade of dour and grey
Helvellyn. But perhaps time, and ivy, will soften the
harshness, dull the too vivid colours, and the ugliness
of to-day may be the beauty of a not-far-off to-morrow.
On the road swings, ever softly on the incline, making
the cycle run easier, and we pass through aisles of
tall larch, beneath the shadow of sheering crags.</p>
<p>For a mile or so we pass through avenues of larch
woods with broken crags ever shouldering against the
roadside; then we come to Launchy Ghyll, the most
extensive break in the mountain wall this side the
lake. Not far from the ghyll, yet some little climb
above the road, is the flat-topped boulder called the
Justice Stone. It has been a famous landmark. It is
suggested that its first use was in the plague years
when the folks of Keswick laid money here to exchange
with pedlars for goods from the outside world. Up
to a century ago the shepherds of the neighbouring
valleys used to meet at this place and exchange
straying sheep. The climb up to the Stone gives
splendid views of the lake and its surroundings, of
Helvellyn range from Seat Sandal to Clough Head,
of three-piked Saddleback, and of Skiddaw.</p>
<p>Armboth House is the next feature: the haunt of
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
the grisliest set of phantoms the Lake Country holds.
For once a year, on All Hallowe&rsquo;en, it is said, the
ghosts of the Lake Country, the fugitive spirits
whose bodies were destroyed in unavenged crime,
come here. I would not like to be present at their
banquet, for they are, according to Harriet Martineau,
an unpleasant lot. Bodies without heads, the skulls
of Calgarth with no bodies, a phantom arm which
possesses no other member, and many a weird shape
beside. But they are a moral lot&mdash;victims and not
sinners. Does the wild shriek in which ere dawning
ends their banquet mean that to the spirit eyes has
come a revelation of their wrongers in torment? But
I forget: no man can hear that cry and live. Yet
people will not believe the straight-forward story of
the Armboth ghosts, of windows lit up with corpse-lights,
of clankings of chains in corridors, of eternal
shriekings which cannot be traced, as though murder
was being done in some secret chamber. But why
has this house been compelled to be a ghosts&rsquo; haunt?
I have never heard a word against its reputation,
ancient or modern. Perhaps it is most central for the
guests to the ghost supper.</p>
<p>From Armboth a road turns over the moors for
Watendlath and Borrowdale. It is a breezy moorland
walk ending in a beautiful glen.</p>
<p>The road leaves the woodlands, and we cycle for
some distance in full view of the water. The land is
fertile meadow; a welcome change from the sterile
wastes. A wood clothes the further shore; the hillside
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
in front is known as the Benn, its summit stands
well out from the fellside to which, if you trouble
to climb so high, you find it is attached by a narrow
spine of rock. Up here the Britons of old had a
fort impregnable to assault. Now we reach the
embankment, which has enlarged the bounds of the
mere. It rises to a great height above the waters at
present, but the engineers say that by a trifling
amount of work the lake would rise sufficiently for
a man, leaning over the parapet, to wash his hands in
it. A road runs the width of the bank, giving a
view up the sheening waters to far-off Dunmail. It
is a pretty picture this&mdash;a succession of bluffs, some
bare and stern, others clothed in clinging scrub of oak
and ash, clustering with larch.</p>
<p>The return road winds round the hill into Legburthwaite,
faces Helvellyn as though seeking a passage
to its stone-strewn head, then turns sharply over a rise,
and we are by Thirlmere again. The first view is
exceedingly pretty. Neither sham castle nor embankment
is visible, and you need not remember that the
mere is semi-artificial. The fells of Armboth face one
like a wall, broken here and there by a narrow ravine.
On the fell you find the dip where Harrop tarn,
beloved of wild fowl, is lying; you trace its rivulet
threading down toward its long home in the lake.
For a long mile we cycle along a terrace road high
above the water, with Helvellyn rising to invisible
heights to the left.</p>
<p>The next point of interest is Wythburn, its little
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
church and inn across the way known over the
wide world. Wordsworth describes his &ldquo;Waggoner&rdquo;
making a journey past here at midnight, and halting at
the Cherry-tree (now a farm), a public-house on the
disused lower road where a merrynight was in progress.
Coleridge has given his tribute to the little house of
God, and other equally famous names occur to one,
who have not disdained to ponder on the simplicity
here. Wythburn was once among the smallest of
English churches, but an addition has been made to
the chancel since those days. In a batch of notes
collected from aged dalesmen many years ago I have
the following story concerning Wythburn.</p>
<p>The rector, after forty-six years&rsquo; constant and
punctual work, caught a chill which, as the week wore
on, prostrated him. On Sunday morning his wife persuaded
him to send word to the clerk to take service
as far as possible and then dismiss the congregation.
Ten o&rsquo;clock came and a quarter past, when the single
bell should have tolled to assemble the congregation.
But to the concern of the invalid its welcoming clatter
did not ring out. To appease him his wife hurried to
the church, half a mile away, to ascertain the cause.
She found the clerk scrambling up the moss-grown
roof with a newly twisted straw rope which had
to be fixed ere the bell could be rung. A wild
goat (there were wild goats on Helvellyn then as
on the Coniston fells now) had during the week
descended from the fell where keep was scant, had
leapt on to the low roof, and, nimbly stepping along
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
the ridge tiles, had found something eatable in the
bell rope.</p>
<p>In another fellside the thatch of the church was once
eaten by sheep. Services were not held in the building
during winter; that was a particularly hard season, and
a snowstorm had scattered the flocks ere they could
be brought down. At still another fellside church
a sudden jerk of the rope was apt to cause the bell
to vacate the steeple, and with a rumble and a thud
it would land in the adjacent field. Something was
wrong with the swivel, but the yeoman who acted as
bell-ringer did not know how to repair it. When the
bell had finished its journey he would carry it back
to its old position, and trust to luck for its remaining
there awhile. But the parish clerk was a character,
a class of himself in the dales, and on theological
topics his voice carried little less weight than that of
the parson. He was an independent fellow as a
rule, and even the visit, once in a lifetime, of a bishop
could not induce him to vary the methods which had
descended to him through half a dozen generations.</p>

<br /><span class="small"><i>HAWESWATER AND THE BIRDS</i></span></h2>
<p>In touring, extremes in conveyances and men meet&mdash;or
perhaps, in these days of petrol, avoid
one another. As the motor begins to monopolise the
main roads, the true pedestrian is driven to the byways
and field-paths. Gone for us seems the pleasure
of swinging steadily, easily, over the hard turnpike;
instead, we trudge in narrow, rutted lanes. Where,
ten years ago, we watched the great events of the dale&mdash;the
funerals, the weddings, the infants carried to
church&mdash;now we must acquire a love for the everyday
repose of Nature, else the Cult of the Hobnail knows
us no more. Green hedges, grass-pitted roadways,
ferns and flowers, birds and beasts of the wilder sort,
must afford us food for observation and contemplation.
Deeper and still deeper into the unknown countrysides
have we to pierce, to taste again the keen delights
of old.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig59">

<p class="caption">HAWESWATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>It is a summer evening; the sky is packed with
loose clouds; the sun&rsquo;s rays, pouring through an
archway left between two grey masses, merely touch
the mountain-tops and are reflected down into the
hollow glen about us. Not a sigh rustles the dense
foliage; everything is dead calm save for the tinkle
of water in yonder dingle&mdash;and the birds! The lark,
the thrush, the whitethroat from its tuft of bosky
grass; the sweet trills of the hedge-sparrow and linnet
in the hedges, the yellow-hammer and the wagtail
among the weatherbeaten outcrops. The stonechat too
is here in his sober livery&mdash;but the harsh &ldquo;natching&rdquo;
calls we hear are not all from its throat. There are
three migrants hereabouts with almost identical
characteristics&mdash;the whinchat, the wheatear, and the
stonechat; but the last-named alone gives the call to
perfection. There he stands on a notch of mossy rock
on the roadside, his body seesawing as he gives forth
the crisp, clear notes. That tuft of crimson feathers
on his alert head distinguishes him from the others.
Extending from the eye backward, they give the
appearance of wearing a closely fitting skull-cap.</p>
<p>The hillsides around are steep, small crags jut out of
their sides. Naddle Forest&rsquo;s northern flank is clothed
with a garth of small oak, through which in rides and
patches the lovelier, livelier sward is seen. As we
top a short rise, our view opens further, and into the
distance stretches another narrow glen, its utmost limits
invisible in a sea of filmy blue mist. In front, against
a patch of bright blue sky, Walla Crag seems to mount
to a tremendous height, its bare rocky facets catching
the wandering gleams. The chorus of evening rises to
rhapsody; then, as the light fades, the feathered choirs
droop to silence and repose. Like a sheet of dull
steel, between banks of darkening green Haweswater
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
now appears. Its outlet is through the plain of
rushes, tall grass, and tangled underwood to the left.
What an ideal spot for a heron! and seldom will
you visit Haweswater without seeing one, more often
a pair, here. The true wanderer will not deem half
an hour ill spent in watching this interesting bird.
As we ramble on, the glassy surface of the lake is
ruffled by the rising evening breeze. The green and
black-grey shadow of Walla Crag&mdash;the clear water
had carried it so faithfully that I thought of Tennyson&rsquo;s
undersea isle&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t5">&ldquo;Where the water is clearer than air:</p>
<p class="t0">Down we looked: what a garden! O bliss, what a Paradise there!</p>
<p class="t0">Bowers of a happier time, low down in a rainbow deep</p>
<p class="t0">Silent palaces, quiet fields of eternal sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But now &ldquo;the Paradise trembles away,&rdquo; the vivid
detail is blurred, its beauty marred.</p>
<p>To Measand we walk in silence. Ever darker, yet
lovely in its gloom, is the lake beside us. Against
the grey skyline the Force, coming in irregular foamy
streaks down the crags, stands out finely. Where
tall hedgerows overhung the roadway, we met a lad
carrying a rod. His fresh, honest face, as fine in its
lines as that of many a woman, attracted my companion,
and, as a fellow in Walton&rsquo;s craft, he asked what sport
the youngster had had. His pannier showed nine trout,
two of fair size. The lad had climbed over the fellsides
to Cordale glen: after rain the upland streams
become torrents and the trout feed voraciously. With
these small brown fish life must indeed consist of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
few feasts and long, weary fasts. When asked what
lure he had been using, the lad replied that, though
he had carried a bundle of worms, the sleugh was
more valuable. This, also called by the dalesmen the
docking-grub, is a small white maggot chiefly to be
found under flat stones in wet places. From angling,
the chat turned to the native red deer. Yes, they
were often seen, two or three generally haunting the
ridges just above. Last winter one died there of
starvation, and to-day, in Cordale glen, the boy had
found the skeleton of another.</p>
<p>The beck we have just crossed comes from Fordendale,
a gully prized by geologists as showing perfectly
the course and action of a past British glacier. A
wood-owl now begins its long-drawn &ldquo;hoot-hoo,&rdquo;
from some glen across the water. A ring-ouzel, the
mountain blackbird of the natives, though it wears a
white crescent on its breast, next flies past. This is
one of the later migrants to arrive, and does not leave
us so long as berries remain on the rowan-trees by the
ghylls. Now we are on the lakeside again: a trout
leaps and returns to the water with a heavy &ldquo;plunk.&rdquo;
A swallow flits along the dark expanse, hawking the
last of the dayflies, and at the same time, with soft
cuttering song, winging home. The last light is
almost dead over the western ridges, and the detail
of things by the roadside is uncertain. See, on that
patch of dripping moss, five flat yellowish leaves from
the centre of which, on a slender bending stem, rises
a flower not unlike the woodland violet in shape. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
is the butterwort, most inaptly named, one of the
three British insectivorous plants. Unroll that curling
leaf and you will find a store of partly-digested flies.
With us in Lakeland the butterwort is usually found far
from cultivation. A plant of the wilds it is, trusting
to the free air rather than to the thin, poor soil for
sustenance. The owl in Naddle Forest has now roused
up a mate: their combined voices come across distinctly.
A faint whistle sounds up the mere: an
otter is out for its nightly raid. As I have observed
him this creature is not an arch-enemy of trout. In
wanton sport he may mutilate numbers of fish, but
his chief diet is the freshwater crayfish. A casual
examination of an otter&rsquo;s hole will prove so much from
the appearance of the excreta; and, while you are
at such close quarters, note the plenty of fish-life in the
pools near by. No further evidence is needed to correct
much misjudgment. In the water the otter is graceful;
in the meadows he lopes along at great speed
when such is necessary. Overland he occasionally
crosses even mountain ranges: lying on Kentmere
High Street one midnight I heard the unmistakable
calls of a pair close by, but the night was too dark for
me to see the creatures.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig60">

<p class="caption">SHAP ABBEY</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Now the road leaves the waterside, and we soon
come to the fell where, in a recess of the rocks,
Hugh Holme hid from his enemies in the days of
King John. Hugh was the first &ldquo;King&rdquo; of Mardale,
and through a long line his name held that peaceful
post. The last direct male descendant died less than
twenty years ago&mdash;he held the ancestral home to the
end, while the Mounseys, &ldquo;Kings&rdquo; of warlike Patterdale,
parted with their birthright long ago. A curious
faint whistling has been gradually drawing my attention.
With a wild cry, like &ldquo;whisp&rdquo; long drawn out, a
woodcock &ldquo;flights&rdquo; in the jerky manner peculiar
to its kind at eventide. The dale is now enveloped
in midsummer darkness; the meadows, but for their
wreaths of white flowerets, would be invisible; the
lake is hardly to be seen for shadows.</p>
<p>The inn is now little over a mile away. Tramp,
tramp,&mdash;there is a cheery something to be felt rather
than expressed in such an excursion. Moths in
quaker grey and white flicker close past; beneath
the sycamores night-beetles hum in busy flight. Now,
on our right, a darker clump: the famous yews of
Mardale almost burying the tiny church in their
green sweep. Tramp, tramp. The yew-tree was
favourite with our fighting fathers: from it they
tore staves for the longbow. The yeomen of Lord
Dacre, recruited from these dales, stood stern and immovable
at Flodden, and by their well-aimed shafts
turned back the Scots in dire defeat. Tradition says
that Rudolphus Holme founded an oratory here in
the fourteenth century. The present little church
dates back some two hundred years; its graveyard
was not consecrated till many years afterward. Even
yet old dalesfolk will point out where the corpse-road
crossed the fells to Bampton. According to such,
there were two roads into Mardale: the assize road,
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
by which, almost as the crow flies, juries went to the
county town; and the road we have mentioned, used
almost exclusively for funerals. There were no bridges
in the dale then, and during winter, and even summer,
the torrents were at times quite impassable.</p>
<p>Just as we pass into the short lane to the inn, there
is a chorus of loud &ldquo;cronks&rdquo; above, and against the
grey night pack we see six dots: a family of carrion
crows hastening home, belated, from some dingle where
perchance a dead sheep is lying. The carrion crow
is larger and more powerful than the rook (which in
the dales is misnamed the crow); its note is harsher
and more jarring. It lacks the majesty of the raven&rsquo;s
croak, and stands apart from the not unmusical
garrulity of the rook. Now, within doors, lights are
gleaming. The hotel looks a home in a land which,
in darkness, to jaded limbs would soon become weary.
Our hostess, with a quiet laugh, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Birds o&rsquo; passage&rsquo; ye call yerselves; &lsquo;here to-day
and gone to-morrow.&rsquo; The hedges and woods are
comfortable to the wee things that come with the
hawthorn&mdash;we&rsquo;ll try to make our inn as welcome
for ye.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small"><i>ULLSWATER, HOME OF BEAUTY</i></span></h2>
<p>To see Ullswater is to love it, and to love a scene
is to often travel that way. I often travelled
there even when so to do meant an eighteen miles&rsquo;
tramp there and an eighteen miles&rsquo; tramp back again.
I have walked there to go fox-hunting, and some rare
chases I have enjoyed&mdash;crags of Fairfield and Helvellyn,
yes! (I have tramped back, too, with shins bumped
and skinned through scrambling among the rocks, and
oh, so weary and footsore.) But we are not fox-hunters
always in the land of the fells, whatever our
detractors say. We do not see beauty in the same
places as they. The &ldquo;splendidly rugged&rdquo; hillside
of the rambler is only &ldquo;bad ground&rdquo; to the shepherd
kind; and the waterfall thundering in the gloomy
dell, so admired by the emotional, arouses little interest
with those who in wild winter have to wrestle with
torrents as foamy and rock-tortured as the finest peep
of Aira or Lodore. We see beauty in the small things
of our everyday life&mdash;in our wee birds and springing
flowers (when the flock does not make us too busy
to notice them). I have seen&mdash;I almost said I know,
but that is too big a boast for even those who
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
dwell there&mdash;Ullswater under almost all conditions.
My first view was from far-off Kentmere High Street.
Only a small portion was visible, still that much <i>was</i>
Ullswater. The next time I saw its long stream from
Helvellyn, but the time was not ripe for going down.
My feet were toward Thirlmere, and the other lake
had to wait awhile.</p>
<p>Shortly, however, I had opportunity&mdash;I started ere
sunrise, and met the light on the top of High Street.
I was still a novice at fellscraft, and knew but little
of the lay of the land. Still, with face set so sure
toward Ullswater, neither map nor guide-book was
required to keep direction. It is wonderfully deceptive,
that descent of Fusedale. From the ridge it seems
that ten easy minutes down the slope would bring one
there, but an hour passed and I had not reached
Howtown bay. On the way I had a distant glimpse of
some deer. On the fells hereabouts a herd of native
red deer roam in a wild state. Sometimes outlyers go
far south, and more than once they have been chased
miles by hounds. A forester looks after the herd&mdash;no
light matter when there is no keep on the uplands
and the half-starved animals break into the turnip
fields, or drive the sheep away from the hay thrown
out for their benefit. The forester also regulates the
constitution of the herd: occasionally there is a day
of thinning out redundant stags or hinds. The red
deer was till comparatively recent times known on
several of our wilder fells. At Ennerdale a piece
of rugged fell known as the Side was a rallying point
for them, and from this they ranged the mountains to
Buttermere and Wastdale, where some few homed
about craggy Scawfell. There was a wild herd on
the Rydal fells for long, and within the memory of
persons not long dead deer used to wander occasionally
on the moorland between Duddon and Esk.
Stories of how their fathers fought the deer in winter
from the stackyards are often told by the dwellers on
Ullswater farms. Hereabouts, too, nested the golden
eagle long after it was extinct in less stern parts. The
last was recorded as shot on the Martindale fells
by a local named Sisson, about seventy years ago. The
bird had been unknown since 1790, when a mature
specimen was shot or trapped in the wilds near
Buttermere. The birds and beasts of Ullswater at that
period would make an interesting list indeed: kites,
eagles, bittern; martens, badgers, wild cats, and the
like. I don&rsquo;t believe there are any wild cats now,
but the sweetmart is not yet extinct, and latterly there
has been a recrudescence of the badger. The foumart
is a noisome beast, and capable of doing great damage
in a poultry roost. Dogs will hunt it with glee, but
are content to corner it, not to bowl it over.</p>

<p class="caption">ULLSWATER, FROM GOWBARROW PARK
<br />A sultry June morn</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>I was disappointed this first time I reached Howtown
to find that the road did not follow the lake shore.
Instead it curves backward over the ridge between
Hallin fell and wall-like High Street. This is a bit of

campers these! Martindale is a really odd corner&mdash;I
think it got its distinctive atmosphere under the
forest laws of Rufus; for except a new bridge and
maybe half a dozen red-painted carts, everything has
the indefiniteness of hoary age. Perhaps it is a
knowledge of its old-world fauna which makes me
place Martindale so far remote in the ages. The road
passes the church; the growing greyness of this makes
its exact year of erection difficult to fix. The clergyman
in charge for long had the smallest direct revenue
in the diocese of Carlisle, and the benefice was often
awaiting acceptance. Nowadays, however, the three
pounds yearly is greatly improved upon.</p>

<p>Past Sandwick there is a return to the mountain
track winding in bracken and cevin. Then for miles,
now a hundred feet up the hillside, now at its level,
the lake is skirted. There is a succession of fine
views, near and distant: of the steamer slipping
through the deep blue water within stone&rsquo;s throw of the
crags, for the lake-bed falls in a precipice here; of
sheep climbing and grazing on the shelving hillside,
and timorously rushing off at our approach; of the
swell when a breeze lifts it along, bursting green on
the boulders and throwing shimmering spray into the
air; of birches in their summer radiance; of thin
green shadows of ghylls where rivulets are slipping
down to the lake through piles of moss; of the
bramble, and the fox-glove and the heather; of the
juniper, the rowan, and the bilberry; of green
Glencoin, and mine-torn Glenridding; of thorny
Gowbarrow; of the hilltops embosoming Matterdale
and its quaint old church, where the sacramental wine
was long kept in a wooden keg, and where many a
dalesman was baptized &ldquo;of riper years,&rdquo; opportunity
not serving to traverse the weary miles from home
when he was an infant. One dweller at least in remote
Martindale (whose chapel was then unused for want
of a cleric), can tell of his &ldquo;kursennin&rsquo;&rdquo; here. He
was a big lad when the family party were rowed
across Ullswater and clomb the brow by Aira Force.
The little church he remembers well, especially he
noted a big bass fiddle hung on the wall near the
font. Fifty years or so later he revisited the place
and pointed out where the fiddle had hung on that
memorable day. One of the fiddlers left his instrument
here between services, out of the way of the
lads. The village orchestra was a feature in old dales
churches&mdash;we were far behind other parts in adopting
the harmonium or the organ. At one place the parson&rsquo;s
wife used to lead the singing on a concertina&mdash;not
very many years ago.</p>
<p>Rounding the fell corner, there is a glorious view
of Helvellyn and Fairfield, empurpled with scree,
rifted with ravines, solid, smooth crags sheering
skyward, often aloof from the bulk of the mountain.
A ragged line etched against the sunny green fell
shows the Striding Edge&rsquo;s top, that other ruggedness
ending with a sharp peak is Swirrel Edge with
Catchedecam. Between these two, and beneath the
wide breast of Helvellyn is that romantic rock-basin
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
where lies Red Tarn, the most notable and highly
elevated of our mountain waters. Trout caught here
are remarkably thick in the shoulder. Our ancient
writers make the char also occupant, but no one
living has, so far as I know, ever seen one there.
As the water is deep, attempts were made half a
century ago to introduce that fish; but whether ova,
fry, or fullgrown fish were turned in, their enemies
accounted for them so well that not one was observed
again. An ancient friend of mine&mdash;an angler and
poacher of wide repute in the old lath-fishing days&mdash;once
told me a wonderful story&mdash;&ldquo;aye, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve caught
&rsquo;em mesel&rsquo;, up to a poond weight&rdquo;&mdash;of a unique race
of fish dwelling in the fringe of the mist at Red
tarn. He called them the silver trout. Their scales
were silvery, their fins small, their flesh dainty. Only
in the deepest pools beyond the reach of a shore rod
were they found; to the lath with its trailing baits
alone they fell. I have from other sources heard a
similar story, but no one lights upon the silver trout
in these days. Old Tom was quite unlettered; it is
unlikely that he ever heard that old books asserted
that the skelly or gwyniad, as well as the char, was
to be found here.</p>
<p>In peak and frowning crag, in shadowy slack and
deep cove, Helvellyn extends far to westward, finally
breaking away at the sun-filled hollow of Grisedale.
Westward again, the debacle, an amazing tangle of
mountains, some throwing a mossy green shoulder
into view, others jagged precipices or walls of scree&mdash;Fairfield
and Cofa Pike, St. Sunday&rsquo;s Crag and Hartsop
Dodd, Red Screes, Kirkstone, and many another.
But to describe yard by yard the opening view were
tedious indeed; when one has climbed almost every
moor and mountain within sight, and walked in many
of the coves and valleys, one is apt to have much to
say which must be familiar to all who know the Lake
Country by repute.</p>

<br />Afterglow</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>There is little of history in the Patterdale of to-day;
the inrush of tourists has caused the old-style cottages
and farms to be renovated almost out of existence.
Bay windows and upper floors take the place of bottle-glass
casements and the old camp bedsteads which
stood in recesses of the one long room, and, by their
great size, formed really chambers within a chamber.
To see Ullswater fully we must be upon it. A boat
is secured and we float down the Goldrill, river of
pretty name and raging furies of floods, under the
bridge. Hereabouts another rivulet joins us, to-day
in quiescent a mood as ours; but it has trilled down
steep Seat Sandal, eddied in dark Grisedale tarn over
the crown of Dunmail, burst in mad career down the
dale of the Wild Swine (Grisedale), losing pace in the
level meadows, and now in a murmur it glides through
the laced alder shade to fall in here. The united
currents send us out on to the lake itself, carrying us
clear of the wide tangle of grasses growing in the silt
the floods carried from Kirkstone and Helvellyn. This
upper basin of Ullswater is where the great lake trout
was last to be found. Though it is several years since
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
an undeniable example, with hooked underjaw, was
caught, the existence of the fish was no myth.
Legend makes too much of its size, asserting that fish
sixty pounds in weight were landed. At flood time
the great trout, states Clarke, writing about a century
and a half ago, ascend the Goldrill, as also in autumn
at the time for spawning. This in his day gave rise
to the sport of spearing, to join in which, he observes
that gentlemen came from great distances. The redds,
a series of sand-bottomed pools, were visited at night;
a torch showed where the fish lay, and the sportsman,
armed with a three-pronged spear, kept striking as
long as a big trout was within his reach. The ordinary
lake trout to-day hasten into the river when a flood
is due, after there has been heavy rain on the fells.
As our boat is pulled from the shore, the grand
panorama of mountains begins to show; the bluffs
behind the village dotted with white hawthorn, and
the flat lands by the river are not yet dwarfed by
more mighty forms. Place fell is the most commanding
sight, two thousand feet of rock rising in unbroken
slope from the water&rsquo;s edge. A level tongue of land
is now quite close by. The whitened current pouring
through acres of silt is silent testimony of mining
activity. This stream has its little tragedy. Once the
char inhabited Ullswater, and spawned in Glenridding
beck. When the mines began to be worked many
breeding char were poisoned by pollution. Others to
save themselves did not shed their spawn, but returned
to the lake. A few afterwards left their ova on the
shallows and among the water grasses, but the following
seasons the females held back their spawn
altogether. The stock of char became rapidly depleted,
and for years there has been no trace of the kind in
the lake.</p>

<p class="caption">HAZY TWILIGHT, HEAD OF ULLSWATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>My taste is not for big hotels, but I will admit that
the Ullswater, with its back to wooded Glenridding,
has a splendid site. It faces across the lake the bloomy
sweep of Place fell, and Helvellyn, with a tumult of
hills around it, is also visible from its grounds. At
the foot of its garden is the steamer pier. To me
there seems little of anachronism about the Ullswater
boats&mdash;I wonder why? At Windermere the yachts
always seem out of sympathy; at Coniston this is
glaringly so (such opinion does not prevent my using
them when convenient); Derwentwater&rsquo;s toy fleet plies
between Portinscale and Lodore, from one palatial
hotel to its neighbour. The boats here are more
business-like. The sharp, near fells, the deep blue
of the water, make one think of beauteous Norwegian
fiords, of arms of the sea where the rise and fall of
tide is scarcely marked on the upspringing rocks, rather
than a lake of quiet England.</p>
<p>Our boat is turned inshore, and we feel the coolness
of nearing woodlands. Above our heads oaks are
clinging in thin profusion to every ledge of a lofty
crag&mdash;this is Stybarrow, the rocky hill dividing Glenridding
from its eastern neighbour. Nowadays a
main road has been cut through the foot of the fell,
just above the level of the water, but a disused zigzag
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
track shows the way dalesmen of the past travelled
to market. Difficult was the track for friends, with
many a rut and spongy mire, sharp curves and slippery
ascents; but for foes from northward it was for
centuries impassable. Little has history to tell of the
head of Ullswater; the customs of the country-side,
the lack of fortified places, of even a Border tower
or of a cattle keep, tell plainly of uninvaded peace.
But though their lands were free from harrying, the
yeomen of Patterdale were ever willing to fight under
the banners of Greystoke and Yanwath. And for thus
leading the foray the wild Scots of Liddelsdale once
almost dealt them retribution. A strong band stole
across the Esk, and during the night rode hard up
the Eden valley and across the grassy fells towards
the lake. Marching unsignalled, from an unusual
direction, their presence was first noted by the shepherds
as they rose from sleeping in the folds on Helvellyn.
One ran to rouse the glen, the others made a rush
down the mountain wall between Glencoin and their
home, hoping to hold the road, the key of the situation,
long enough for their friends to rally and beat back
the invasion. Mounsey was a stout yeoman, had seen
service long and hard in Border campaigns, and he
it was who took command. He placed his few where
the road narrowed between two crags and was steepest,
where the rocky ground prevented the dreaded charge
of the enemy&rsquo;s horse. The Scots came riding on,
unaware that their presence had been discovered till a
flight of arrows whizzed from rock and bush. Thrown
into disorder by these, a second volley sent the raiders
hot-trod to the foot of the hill. Here they formed
an attack, leaving their ponies, taking what cover they
could find. They reached the belt of timber, and
carefully crept through it without finding an enemy,
for the men of the dale had after their ambush retired,
so that the shock with the full weight of the Scottish
force could not be brought to bear on them at a
disadvantage.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig65">

<p class="caption">A MOUNTAIN PATH, SANDWICK, ULLSWATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>The leader halted at the upper edge
of the forest to survey the situation. To his eye,
there was no way of winning up that lofty hill while
the bows were plied from shelter secure. Accordingly
he halted, sending scouts to right and left. The chief
had certain knowledge of the number of men-at-arms
in Patterdale; he had brought a party strong enough
to crush their utmost resistance, and had cut off their
chance of alarming their allies of the low country.
One scout told that away to the left the fell
became a terrific precipice, along the wooded ledges
of which a party might move to attack the dalesmen&rsquo;s
rear. Fifty were accordingly detached to force the
way of the cliff. Safely they passed through the wood
of Glencoin, then swarmed cautiously from ledge to
ledge of the dizzy crag; the blue lake beneath received
the stones they dislodged. Of a sudden the leader
of the forlorn hope reeled, threw up his arms, fell
back and down&mdash;down&mdash;down. Undaunted by his
wild cry and the splash which after a pause showed that
his body had fallen from ledge to ledge into the lake,
from their path in mid-air the Scots sought the archer
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
in vain. Another man, with a strange gurgle, swung
round, grasping at the cloth-yard that had transfixed
him. He too fell into the abyss. When the tenth
had been struck, one of the Scots espied the enemy.
So far away, and deep below, that he looked merely
a doll, an archer stood on a rock by the shimmering
water. Mounsey had divined their plan, and with
his strong arm and sure aim saved Patterdale from
invasion.</p>
<p>The Scottish leader waited hour after hour for the
wild slogan which should proclaim that his men had
attacked the ridge, then a few stragglers returned
from the face of the cliff and told him of the disaster
which had befallen. The word was given at once
&ldquo;to horse,&rdquo; and the raiders sped back to the Border.
For his service the men of Patterdale claimed the
Mounsey as their king. He was given the best house
and land, on condition that he, and his heirs for ever,
should be able and willing to lead the dalesmen to
victory. For centuries the family held their post with
distinction. The first Scottish rabble to break into the
glen were the men of the Forty-Five. And they did
not get far beyond, for the men of Troutbeck manned
the narrow head of their dale and, unaided by the
Royal army, beat back the invasion. For which the
courage of Patterdale is still slighted across the fell.
The last King of Patterdale flourished a century ago;
his estates were afterwards sold to the Marshall family.
The name and lineage of Mounsey still exists in the
dale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>I find legend a too-fascinating topic; get the boat
pushed forward if we have to see Aira Force this golden
afternoon. The wavelets rattle gay under the bow
as we sweep past soft Glencoin, with a solitary house
glimmering through the trees&mdash;Seldom Seen, once, it is
said, the jewel-house of the Howards in time of serious
war. But the greatest beauty is on Place fell. In
bands of green and brown and golden yellow, in purple
streak and white, it rises rock on rock, slope on slope,
more the presiding genius of Ullswater than vaunted
but distant Helvellyn. The rugged Gowbarrow we
are approaching is tame and smooth compared with the
giant across the water. Tree-fringed, with brake of
bramble and low bushes, the road runs along the
northern shore; beyond bay after bay we find it
keeping pace with us apparently. It is a level run
for the cyclist, and happy is he who first at sunset
approaches by it. On a curve of white shingle we
land; the field is glorious with water buttercups, and
the last wild roses star the brakes around. The gorge
of Aira is quite half a mile from the lake. Leaving
the road Lyulph&rsquo;s tower cannot be evaded by the
observing eye. Who Lyulph was is a disputed point
among the Doctors; his name was given to this place
after he was long dead: he wasn&rsquo;t foolish enough to
design or build this erection. Relief comes to the soul
when, rising up the hill, you see the meadows where
the daffodils blow, the place where Dorothy Wordsworth
pointed out to her gifted brother the flowers dancing
in the breeze and struck the chord which gave us
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
the fine poem known as &ldquo;The Daffodils.&rdquo; Aira Force
too has its story of love and romance, which is
briefly stated thus: A lady dwelling beneath knotty
Gowbarrow loved a knight of Cumbria, and they were
wont to tryst by the waterfall. The lover, to prove
his love and gain honour, joined a crusade. No news
of him came from Syria for years&mdash;he was a prisoner
there&mdash;and the lady, lonely and much troubled, began
to fear that he had fallen. At length the knight broke
prison and hastened home. At night he approached
the trysting place of old, and through the trees saw
a lady in white moving. He sprang forward to meet
her&mdash;it was his own true love for whom he had
jeopardised his life&mdash;just as she came to the crag which
overhangs the torrent&rsquo;s leap. In his arms he held her
a moment, then she started back, back, and out of sight&mdash;down
that terrible rock, into the gloom of the spout.
After her leapt the brave knight&mdash;he found her in the
whirlpool, caught her, and reached the shore. And
there, as he bent over her, she opened her eyes a
moment and recognised him; with his name on her
lips she died. The sudden shock, the fall, the deep
waters, had beaten out the frail life of the somnambulist.
By the waterfall the knight built him a cell, and,
a hermit, dwelt in the solitude.</p>
<p>The hollow of Aira is a gloomy place: moist-loving
ferns spread over the rocks, there is wet moss
everywhere, spray ever hangs dank in the air. In
height Aira is great among our waterfalls. In flood-time
it is a glorious medley: flying waters, shiny
fangs of rock, dripping trees and grass and weed and
fern.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Although the lower portions of the lake, toward
Pooley, do not come into this brief survey, they are
far from unlovely, though to most the beauties do
not begin till Hallin fell is abreast and wild Gowbarrow.
The eastern reaches are more domesticate&mdash;green
swelling hills and wide woodlands, with many-acred
spaces of smooth pasture. To the south of
the lake&rsquo;s outlet is Swarth fell, a haunt of straight-necked
foxes (I have been at their chase from far-off
Kentmere), and to the north is Dunmallet, another of
those curious &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; found among our lake mountains.</p>
<p>My finest experience of Ullswater was on a summer
evening. Our boat, to quiet pulling, stole out into
the upper lake. The sun was nearly down to Fairfield.
When about opposite Silver Bay oars were
taken in&mdash;their solemn steady chunking sound seemed
to mar the harmony of even. A few men and women
were wandering the paths by the mouth of Glenridding,
but no one was afloat. Away over the horizon, behind
the fells, thunder is still echoing. An hour ago
raindrops dimpled the lake&rsquo;s surface; the air was
dark and brooding, every few seconds a vivid flash of
lightning rent the gloom, and blast after blast of
heaven&rsquo;s trumpet seemed to shake the mountains to
their deep-set foundations. After storm, calm&mdash;and
refreshment and peace at eventide. From westward
pour the generous, kindly beams of light, pouring out
new life to rain-dashed fields and woodlands, giving
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
new songs and glorious to the birds. What a glory
of colouring mantles field and fell and forest. Though
a wide gate is cleared for the sun in its latest hour,
dense clouds are still overhead, and the north-east is
ink-black. The sun touches the topmost ridge of
Fairfield with living fire, and just beneath is a deep
fold of violet vapour. Place fell is glorious with
purple light, its riven ghylls mysterious with a deeper
tinge. Along the craggy face of Helvellyn a soft
veil of mist is rolling: from hollow Grisedale come
cloudy wreaths and streams which bathe the mountain-top
ere they dissolve in the amber even. Around us
Ullswater spreads, blue as the bluest of our summer
skies; its ripples, like frolicking children, rejoice in
careless mirth. Now the sun hides behind the turmoil
of mountain-tops, and we are in a vale of glorious
shadow. The faint lake-current and the soft-moving
breeze drift us ever down the mere: we are past
Glenridding, the climbing shadow has risen far up
Place fell. Above, all is clear and golden; a sharp
line passing along the hillside marks off the zone of
light. The sheep are wandering upward as the day
retires; from the summits they will greet the first
gleams of to-morrow. The dusk gathers in every
hollow; night is softly, reluctantly, drawing in. Still
the drama of sunset ebbs tardily on the rocky heights;
a wee wafer of cloud, the last of its tribe it seems, is
drawing away from the flaming west. As it curls
and rolls its course up the sky, its brilliance fades
to crimson, to thin purple, and, as a grey lock, it fades
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
out of sight at the zenith. Boats are now astir on
our Ullswater: hardly can there live a man, or woman,
so dead to the beauties of Nature as to willingly stay
indoors on such an eventide. So time passes: we
drift beneath the bulk of Place fell, then the oars
are put out and in the shade we steal along. Grey-blue
are the heights behind Glencoin, all the glory
has gone from the western sky. The clouds have
crept out of the north, and streaks of pulsing night-glow
come up in their stead. Brown the woods on
the hillside above us, and a silence of sleep reigns
supreme. A rill falling into the lake rattles pleasantly;
the soft whistle of an otter, the wing-beat of a bird
hawking the night moths, the sudden splash as a
trout falls from its leap into mid-air, break pleasantly
on the ear.</p>
<p>Look above: the mountains shoulder to great
frowning heights, but the marvel of all is the sky.
There seems no firmament, no bound to the ranging
eye. Only the gate of heaven itself seems withdrawn
from vision. Star-drift, in soft luminous puffs, besprinkles
the great violet dome: planet and fixed star,
great and small, dust over the immeasurable width
with ten million sparkling lights. On most nights it
is the stars that seem so far away, but to-night, by
quiet Ullswater, they discover themselves as milestones
near us on the way to that distant blue curtain which
is the nearer boundary of heaven itself. More
comprehensible is the element beneath us, where over
plunging depths are mirrored the twinkling stars.
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
There again the light is a veil to a mystery, but not
a boundless one. For we know what manner of
things lie beneath the waters: their pits have been
plumbed and their secrets discovered. There is a flush
of pale primrose in the east: the moonrise. How the
the frail light glows! We turn the corner of Hallin
fell toward Howtown ere the full orb at last rolls
into sight. In a few minutes the fells are radiant
with the peaceful beams, and a broad track of silver
leaps down the bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small"><i>MOUNTAIN TARNS</i></span></h2>
<p>Perhaps it were more correct to say &ldquo;minor
waters,&rdquo; for some are hardly within the pale
of the mountains. There are, on fell and in dale,
above thirty of these tarns, and, as the lakes vary in
type of charm, so do these. Their variety, moreover,
is even more bewildering than that of the lakes. In
the latter&rsquo;s wide landscapes, no matter what the
circumstances of weather or season, one cannot mistake
Windermere for Ullswater, Derwentwater for Wastwater.
The tarns are, however, entirely different. I
think particularly of three views of Angle tarn,
under Bowfell, so distinct in what a poet would
call their emotions, that memory will hardly
recognise the three as having but one geographical
position. Scarcely daybreak, we had passed the
summit of Bowfell into Ewer Gap. We could see
hardly five yards in front, and ere long our leader,
though well accustomed to the fell under most circumstances,
confessed that he was astray. But on
we plodded: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get somewhere,&rdquo; though that
might be over the crags into Eskdale or headlong
down the precipices into Langstrath. At last, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
the others began to descend a dangerous slope,
the bottom of which could not be seen for boiling
mist, I commanded a halt. In a minute or two
the mist was torn aside by the morning breeze,&mdash;chill,
raw, and damp it was even after the fold of
night-cloud,&mdash;and there &ldquo;blae as wad,&rdquo; as we of the
dales say, was Angle tarn sheer beneath. Solitary,
within a weirdly uptossed land, its shoals seen
through a veil of blue water, its depths showing in
greater quality of cobalt. We were perched on the
front of a lofty rock: a dozen yards forward might
have ended in an accident. I am not likely to forget
that scene: grey dawn, the brisk breeze, the mist
scurrying out of the riven crags around, the eerie
feeling of desolation&mdash;we were in touch with the soul
of Nature at her moment of uprising. Again I saw
the tarn at daybreak. We had climbed in the velvety
July darkness up the rough penance of Rossett ghyll.
The small expanse of water looked violet cool in the
growing light; it was calm, and austere with the
austerity of a virgin Alpine pool it seemed to me. A
soft greyness which the most marvellous steel engraving
cannot picture draped all things made, till the great
sun leapt over Helvellyn and hurled day on to a land
of dreamy repose. Again I came that way when the
August sun beat down, and the great barrier of
mountains seemed to tremble and to swim in heat-haze.
The waters laving the harsh crags were a deep
pitiless blue. One felt that the hard blaze had driven
all sense of coolness from them. The grass drooped on
the fellsides, parsley fern and mountain moss
suspended life and made patches of dusty brown, the
crags were grey with drought. Not a tree in sight,
not a line of shadow save right up there, almost at
the mountain-top, a refreshing triangle of darkness,
&ldquo;the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.&rdquo; One&rsquo;s
inmost soul felt the harshness of that day, and that by
it the land was robbed of much fairness.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>And what romantic situations are occupied by some
of our tarns. There is Red tarn, above which towers
the upper rampart of Helvellyn. To right is Striding
Edge, to left the narrow ridge of Catchedecam. How
fine a gloom does the old mountain throw at sunset
over this beauteous spot! There is Stye Head tarn,
abode of horror, the gloom and beauty of which so
impressed Ruskin. The romance of this tarn is
heightened when one is privileged to visit it by
moonlight. How the great rock-billows, greyly seen,
overtower the tiny gully! How man with all his petty
conceits falters in the presence of the greatness of
Nature&rsquo;s majesty! One side the pass is impenetrable
darkness; across, the light accentuates every ruggedness;
streaks from the skyline show where the rivers fall
from parent heights. &ldquo;I felt that I could take out
a half-penny and crawl out of sight under it,&rdquo; said a
very unimpressionable person to me after such an
experience. &ldquo;The loneliness crushed my voice, my
mind, and, as it seemed to me, my stature. I would
have hidden from the scorn of all things made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our minor waters cannot claim much history: most
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
of them are too far into the wilds to be mentioned
in ancient story, except in a hazy and collective fashion.
Several of our lakes have been served likewise. But
that humanity knew of them in far-off ages is sure.
By Whinfell tarn Britons of old lived; a canoe was
some years ago dug out of the oozy peat there. And
on the opposite side of the Country there are extensive
ruins of a city within a mile of Devoke Water. Who
built Barn Scar cannot be told with surety; for long
legend put it down to Danes who peopled it with
lads of Drigg and lasses of Beckermet.</p>
<p>But if legitimate history has failed, there is amplitude
of legend. Most will have heard of the deathless
fish who are said to live in the depths of Bowscale
tarn; of the fairy chasm in the sunless deeps of Scales
tarn under the frowning Edges of Saddleback. On
the fells about them have been seen mysterious armies,
coming, coming. Brothers Water has its story of
gloom and death: how two pairs of brothers were
drowned in it. Of Grisedale tarn, storehouse of King
Dunmail&rsquo;s crown, I have told the story. Gates Water,
by Coniston Old Man, has a few weird stories, but
they are entwined hopelessly almost. There are stories
of pigmies and giants who lived in the wildernesses,
of fairies and evil spirits who wail over shapeless
mounds of rock, ruins of cities of uncouth days for
aught we know.</p>

<p>To see the heart of Lakeland, one should make
the pilgrimage of the Mountain Tarns. It will not
be an easy task: the highest fells will have to be
crossed&mdash;it will need perseverance and strong boots.
And even in these days of motor and cycle some
humans can and will walk. Many a mile of breezy
moorland will be found on such a pilgrimage; not
weary when the heather&rsquo;s purple bells are at their
widest, when green grass clothes the ghylls, when the
rowan flowers, and the white foam of hawthorn dapples
the fellsides,&mdash;many a mile of rock and crag, rain-washed,
frost-scored, scree-strewn, lichen-covered,
many a mile of smooth upland where curlew and
plover whistle and wail, where raven and hawk flight
for carrion and live prey, where fox and otter, and
even red deer, are to be discovered by the alert, nooks
where grow our rarest ferns and mosses, waterfalls
and rattling cascading becks.</p>
<p>Such a pilgrimage would commence outside the
range of the fells. The pedestrian would strike north
from the town of Kendal&mdash;a grey &ldquo;burgh of ancient
charter proud&rdquo;&mdash;for Whinfell tarn. This is a tarn of
the renascence, think the fell-wanderers; Nature having
shed her grandest pearls in the gorges and on the
rock-shelves to westward, came to bestow her final
blessing in the low country. She sat beneath whin-patched
Beacon and wept over the sweet scene she
could not really decorate. But of all her plenishings
she still had a trace, and well she bestowed them: the
roach, forgotten when char were placed in Winander;
a knot of curious weeds which soft currents sway in
the peat-bottomed pools, and&mdash;a boat. This old punt
so often went to the bottom that it was as muddy
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
as a street on a wet day. Nature, those countless
&aelig;ons ago, endowed Whinfell tarn with it&mdash;it was
long before emulous Britons fashioned that moss-buried
canoe&mdash;and what better craft was there, said the
contented folk who lived thereabout. But Nature
has been superseded in these days, and a boat made
by man floats near the reed beds where the angler
seeks the pike.</p>
<p>Thence up &ldquo;Robert Elsmere&rsquo;s&rdquo; dale to Greycrag
tarn&mdash;a lonesome sheet of water under a towering fell-end.
It has, say some, a store of amphibious fish; nine
months of the year they rejoice in water, the remainder
they spend in the depths of the moss. During hot
weather the tarn is often quite invisible. I have never
seen trace of a fish in Greycrag&rsquo;s mere, but Old Bob,
a veteran rodman of the glens, assures me that they
exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I once protested, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noo, luk sta here: when t&rsquo; watter&rsquo;s lah, thoo can
hear &rsquo;em as weel as see &rsquo;em. Yan warm day ah was
walkin&rsquo; on t&rsquo; bog be t&rsquo; tarn edge, an&rsquo; aw on a sudden
ah hard &rsquo;em. Yan said, &lsquo;Say, Billy, it&rsquo;s rare an&rsquo;
warm to-day?&rsquo; &lsquo;Aye, an&rsquo; ther&rsquo;s less watter an&rsquo; aw.
T&rsquo; lile crag&rsquo;s a yerd oot.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thoo nivver says sae!
Well, well, hooivver. We&rsquo;ll hae to git to wark an&rsquo; dig
doon.&rsquo; T&rsquo; watter just afoor me turnt aw mucky, an&rsquo;
ah couldn&rsquo;t see t&rsquo; fish.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s corroboration with
a vengeance.</p>
<p>Old Bob it was also who first gave me the story of
the overland pike and eels which reside in Skeggles
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
Water, a peaty pool on the waste between Longsleddale
and Kentmere, visible as you climb up the steeps to
Greycrag. These marvellous fish have the power o&rsquo;
wet nights of leaving the tarn, and slithering their
way across the grass patches to where the water runs
down into Longsleddale. I have found a dozen men
willing to swear they have seen the fish on their
journey, but not one who has actually captured a
specimen.</p>
<p>From the realms of fancy to the domain of beauty
and to Kentmere tarn. This laves the lower screes of
Hillbell and Froswick, but Nature&rsquo;s Kentmere was
four miles down the glen. Thirty years or so ago the
landlords organised draining operations, and found that
they had exchanged two hundred acres of beautiful
water for as much useless marsh. Nature, interfered
with, had retaliated. The upper reservoir is more
strikingly situated. Great mountains leap upward from
its shores, scores of brawling streamlets force their way
down the sides into it. There are two favourite times
for fishing this mere&mdash;when a gentle sou&rsquo;wester ruffles
the surface and you get out your fine river tackle, and
when after rain the fish scent a feast. It is a case of
knowing where the shoals lie thickest for making
a pannier.</p>
<p>As we stroll by the water, we have in front the
tallest buttress of High Street, about the flanks of
which are studded four beautiful waters&mdash;Small Water,
Blea Water, Hayes Water, and Angle tarn. The
nearest of these is reached over Nan Bield pass by
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
which a fair amount of inter-dale traffic passes. One
day a flock of sheep will make the grey rocks ring with
their plaints, another they may resound to the mellower
lowings of driven cattle. My first glimpse of Small
Water was at sunset. Afternoon was far spent when
we faced the mountain ways. Along the hilltops the
sun flashed golden fire, the fells to eastward were
haloed in bright mist, cool shadows fell and spread
around. Then after an (it seemed an interminable)
hour, we came here. Not a spark of direct light fell
into the hollow of the hills, but the waters shook
off responsive glows to day&rsquo;s aftermath reigning in the
skies. The air was hushed, the wagtails flittering
about the grey stones were soothed to cuttering
monotones. Oh, to stay were glorious indeed, to
watch the now radiant vault fade through most subtle
hues to grey and then to clear blue of night and starry
rest. But on we had to go&mdash;often the most ravishing
scene has to be inexorably hurried through, for man
has many interests, and the most peaceful, the most
soul-filling, are not in the way of the world the most
important. Would that more of us could, like the
poets whose dreamings inspired the mighty deeds of
old, and of to-day as well, sit by the hour in these
realms of beauty and delight, and calmly let their spirit
sink into us. We would write better, live better; but
what we call duty intervenes and the inner pulsations
of living nature remain unknowable. Nature as seen
indoors with the microscope is unfolded to us every
day by our great leaders of thought; but few of these
great minds care for or have the leisure to instil
into themselves, and thence transmit to us, the broader
splendours of field and fell and mere.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Small Water fills a tiny depression in the mountain;
it is well stocked with trout, many of which have a
curiously large number of vermilion spots on them.
The angler who comes here on an evening in late
July may find recompense for his trouble, but a
rodman&rsquo;s panoply is no light weight to bring those
three miles from Mardale, or six from Kentmere.</p>
<p>From the upper crags of High Street one looks
into a deep well, bounded by rock and scree, to see
lonely Blea Water. Its shores are fringed with great
fragments rent from the rugged heights which almost
overhang. The raven nests in inaccessible gullies above
the rippling waters, and one associates their solemn
croakings with the shadow-filled basin of crag. A
few stunted perch exist in the sterile mere: what hope
of rich life can there be from rain-flooded ghylls and
mist-moistened crags? Only at sunrise does the scene
become joyous. From beyond the Pennines the day&rsquo;s
first warming beams kiss life into seams and rents,
signs of wild winter nights and gloomed, frosty days.
One great rock-sentinel has a story of the dalesman
sport of fox-hunting to tell. Its front is split up
by a score ravines, where the stone is rotten and
weather-worn. Ledges where a fox can lie at peace
from the baying pack are there in scores: Reynard can
climb up and down where the agilest hound dare not
approach. During one long chase the fox, sorely
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
pushed, attempted to &ldquo;benk&rdquo; in this crag. The
pack, to prevent accidents, were &ldquo;whipped off.&rdquo; The
followers essayed to examine the rock-face to discover
the redskin and, if possible, to oust him from his
refuge. In his eagerness one Dixon, scrambling in a
rotten ghyll-head, slipped and fell headlong to a great
depth. His body rebounded thrice from the rocks&mdash;hence
the shattered watercourse is known as &ldquo;Dixon&rsquo;s
Three Loups.&rdquo; With both legs broken, the fallen
sportsman came to rest, jammed behind a pinnacle of
rock. Espying the fox making cautiously over the
vertical rock he called to his friends, who were with
the hounds, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cummen oot be t&rsquo; hee end; lig
t&rsquo; dogs on.&rdquo; Reynard&rsquo;s ruse was frustrated, and a kill
made in due course. Dixon&rsquo;s injuries, beyond the
fractured legs, must have been confined to contusions,
for, years afterwards, he joined in the hunt with
unabated keenness.</p>
<p>Hayes Water has no story to tell the wanderer:
it is out of the way of history and legend. Many
a hunt passes along its glen, but no commanding
crags claim adventure and peril. It is among the
most beautiful of our tarns, and the ghyll by which
its outflow passes to the Goldrill is a paradise.
Cataract and dimpling pool, lush moss and clinging
ivy, alder, rowan, ash, and birch; here the beck gurgling
in a deep channel, there, in the realm of bracken,
sliding down the hardened stone it cannot pierce. The
stream is a playground of the dipper, the wagtail,
the kingfisher. Suddenly the rivulet charges down
a rocky ravine, and emerges, as a clear, calm brook,
in the level glen of Goldrill. But one hardly yet
follows it, for across the heather and towsled grass
there is an Angle tarn to see. This small pool on
the level moor is a haunt of the wild red deer from
Martindale. Skeletons of several of them were found
here after the terrible winter of 1895, when for weeks
the ground was frost-bound, and the heather buried
in snow. But Angle tarn, as well as Hayes Water,
is famous to the angler; permission to enjoy this
sport must, however, be sought from the lord at
Lowther Castle, in whose manor both lie.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig70">

<p class="caption">A SUDDEN SHOWER, BLEA TARN</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>Brothers Water, up a branch of the Goldrill,
affords fair sport to the rod. Its shores the wandering
kind would think, but erroneously, tame. No huge
crag leaps up from it, but its surroundings are of
singular ruggedness. The lofty, bristling front of
Red Screes, and the purpled fields of broken crag on
Kirkstone fell, face the nobbly Hartsop Dodd. The
ridges are cut up by narrow chasms down which
in flood-time, like hordes of wild horses, unbridled
torrents fling. The glen above the tarn is given
over to one of the largest sheep-farms in the district.
Its acreage is counted, as its fleeces, by the thousand.</p>
<p>It is a far cry and a rugged way to Grisedale tarn,
but the climb is worth doing. Up the ghylls you
climb on your route to Fairfield; and when you reach
the topmost ridge in sight, you find the deep narrow
gulf of Deepdale lies between. You detour round the
head of this glen. It is glorious wild country, this
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
home of shepherd craft. There is no good path; you
follow the wandering sheep-tracks where they serve,
and leave them the moment you find their trend
unfavourable. It is eerie when the mist suddenly
wraps around. Then you may have to trust to dead
reckoning for your safety. But, on a clear day,
the vertical views from the narrow approach to Fairfield,
into Rydal and Deepdale are charming: on either
horizon is the flash of water&mdash;Windermere, Coniston,
Ullswater. The ridge of Fairfield crossed, suddenly
breaks a new glen into the mountain wall, and at the
same time there is revealed to you a whirlpool of
distant summits. Right below is the tarn of Grisedale.
Seen on a dull day it is an abode of mystery: deep,
so deep blue that one feels that it were a lower
firmament; pure, so pure and fresh that it seems
impossible that through it one might not journey to
a fairy paradise.</p>
<p>This grand cleft in the mountain wall was haunt of
the wild boar and of great eagles for long after less
wild regions were cleared. To-day you see nothing
sterner than the peregrine whizzing after towering
larks. I well remember assisting to drive a flock
across this upland basin. Of all scenes in dales life,
few are prettier than well-driven sheep passing over
open land. The collies, watchful, obedient to call or
whistle of their master, follow the wings of the mob;
the shepherd is behind the centre, and the broad front
of grey fleeces and black faces, a thousand or more
strong, steadily, readily, moves to pastures new, and the
delicate green grass, with grey crags and darker stripes
of moss, combines all into an idyllic picture.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig71">

<p class="caption">KIRKSTONE PASS AND BROTHERS&rsquo; WATER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>From Grisedale, there is Helvellyn to climb on the
way to Red tarn, and to a tiny pool beneath the
northern screes known as Keppel Cove tarn. A tour
further afield would be across the knife-like Edges
of Saddleback to the lonesome tarns immured beneath
their cliffs. We, however, journey over the ridge
between Fairfield and Seat Sandal for Grasmere&rsquo;s sweet
vale. There are many views across the pass to Helm
Crag, with its uncouth rocks on top, figures of
monsters frozen speechless from the dim twilight of
time.</p>
<p>From Grasmere there is a particularly fine mountain
walk, with a ring of tarns as its objective. Starting
from the tourist village one passes up Easedale, then
begins to ascend the side of Sour Milk ghyll. Come
when there has been rain and a tortured chain of water
flies down four hundred feet of rocks, in a succession
of gleaming spouts. But in the days of drought the
rocky pathway is bare and almost dry, the rivulet drips
noiselessly down the inclined rocks. At the head of
the force you enter the realm of the fell properly.
The true mountain moth flutters by; the moss beneath
your feet is racemed with fox&rsquo;s tail, least civilised
of plants. The ring-ouzel, the blackbird of the fells,
is often here&mdash;in the waterworn rocks are its nesting-places.
The bracken throws off its sweetest scent.
The tarn side is a peaceful scene under most conditions,
but when a gale rages you see the water fly off in
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
sheets. The scene is glorious, but the buffetings are
tremendous. Easedale tarn is among the larger in
size, its trout are more easily caught at hours and
seasons when the tourist is unknown. At evening get
out the boat and float toward the outlet. The weeds
here are the nightly haunt of the best fish.</p>
<p>Our next tarn is Codale, perched on a shelf six
hundred feet higher than Easedale tarn&mdash;a mere rock
pool, but in situation most romantic. Fishing here&mdash;well,
there are a few trout to be got by the lucky.
&ldquo;Codale tarn? Ah, we used to come at it after we
had done Stickle tarn. Old Jonty knew it well. Once
when I was with him&mdash;it was a blazing June day&mdash;he
said he could get the fish in Codale. &lsquo;How?&rsquo; I
asked. &lsquo;By minding my own business.&rsquo; He produced
two lengths of line, and along them fixed the
hooks and baits common to the lath. &lsquo;Noo, thee
gang that side o&rsquo; t&rsquo; tarn, ah&rsquo;ll gang this.&rsquo; The line
was between, and we soon dragged the narrow water
from one to the other. There wasn&rsquo;t a fish missed.
One after another they swum up; what the baits were
Old Jonty wouldn&rsquo;t say&mdash;salmon roe most like, for
he was a terrible poacher. We got four pounds of
fish with the single drag, more than I had seen in
a week of tarn fishing in that blazing weather.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig72">

<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>A few weird things are told of the wild upland where
lies Codale tarn, stories as wild as the demon hunts
of Dartmoor. Through the mists the wanderer often
fancies a face distraught with pain and toil. It is the
weird of a lost soul. The first time I was a-wandering
in this region I was caught in a dense cloud, and, the
stories still fresh in my mind, I felt rather nervous
that some horror would come to light. It is wonderful
what vivid imaginings come when one is astray
in the mist. I have a great many times seen visions
in the grey beards&mdash;so clear, so true, that once I
hailed a comrade whose face I saw, though he himself
was forty miles away. Codale tarn, to my mind, is the
prettiest mere of all: stand back from its outlet and
drink in the picture&mdash;the narrow dark band of water,
the great pile of rock dabbed with spits of grass,
seamed with moss-laces and with parsley fern. Above
the crags, where a spot of snow oft lingers till June,
is the azure sky, and the dots of winged things.</p>
<p>Over the hills and away to the tarn of Stickle.
At clear midnight the hollow is at its finest&mdash;when
the sky is gemmed with stars and over the jagged
Pavey Ark the northern light pulses and flows, and
the mountains swim in delicate folds of vapour. It
is fairy time&mdash;the wee folk <i>must</i> survive in this
abode of eternal peace. The crags overhanging the
tarn are full of problems for the rock-climbing cult&mdash;one
or two of the gullies are almost first-rate. The
&ldquo;shepherd&rsquo;s path,&rdquo; which few dalesmen ever use, is
dangerous to any one not trained to this severe work&mdash;I
mention this as a warning. The tarn holds trout
of large size and exceptional quality. In winter this
basin is an awesome place for a ramble. The great
plinth which ends Pavey Ark rises almost without
a patch of white&mdash;a pillar of darkness. Other parts
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
of the fell are plentifully smeared with drifts. When
the snow has lain for a week or two there is snow
craft to be practised here, but things are better further
afield on the Scawfell group.</p>
<p>From Stickle our wanderings should carry us down
past the racing fosse, and away into Little Langdale
where we pause at Blea tarn. This was the haunt
of Wordsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Solitary,&rdquo; chief figure in his poem,
&ldquo;The Excursion.&rdquo; Little Langdale tarn, which lies
somewhat further down the glen is a small weedy pool
in a meadow-land. Its waters for long have provided
little sport, for they are overstocked with tiny useless
trout. A net used with judgment might improve the
fishing here. But Little Langdale tarn has its own
peculiar charm of quietness. It is a haunt of the
heron and otter. And over it stands the grand barrier
of Tilberthwaite fell, from the base of which, in
solemn echoing blasts, &ldquo;the quarried thunders ring.&rdquo;
The hillsides around are pitted with ugly little scars
of abortive quarries. Still down the glen, we pass
Colwith, where the stream makes a sudden leap into
a lower country. It is a pretty enough spout, but on
enclosed ground, and therefore few wanderers of the
fells confess its beauty. The white farm at the cross
road, as you turn into Great Langdale, of course has
been an inn. One of its old-time landladies was wont
only to brew when there was a prospect of sale. The
water from the spring was good enough for her household,
with milk if they felt dainty. Her customers
chiefly came eastward over Wrynose pass. It was a
long stretch, and a thirsty, from the last tavern in that
direction. The landlady was not accustomed to waste
material, so every morning when she judged that
packmen from Whitehaven were due she walked up
the hill above the farm to watch for their coming. If
but few ponies appeared crawling down the steep, then
the malt was stinted, but if the pass-head was, in her
opinion, &ldquo;black wi&rsquo; folk,&rdquo; more ale was prepared.
One morning a traveller, tired of the slow pack-train,
pushed on ahead, and duly came to the inn. Ale he
called for, and was informed: &ldquo;Oh aye, ye can hae ale,
but it&rsquo;s rayther warm just yet.&rdquo; The traveller had
beaten the new brew down to Colwith.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>To Elter Water the lane winds through dense coppice,
and emerges into the open just before the village is
reached. Here the chief industry is the making of
gunpowder, with also slate quarrying and the production
of the famous Langdale linen. John Ruskin
it was whose teaching brought this craft back into
being, and in a quiet way it is doing good to the
valley. I wonder if the dales farmer will ever turn
his attention to the cultivation of flax. At one time
a plot of this staple was more necessary to a farmstead
than a vegetable or even a herbal garden.</p>
<p>Elter Water is a larger picture of the elements
comprised in Little Langdale tarn. Except that it
is at the foot of the Langdales there is little to be said
about it. The pike are so numerous that few perch
even stay with them. Loughrigg tarn, which we visit
before getting over the ridge to Grasmere, is of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
different class to any we have yet met with. Christopher
North described it as &ldquo;a diamond set in emeralds,&rdquo;
and he was not wrong. Where are waters more
sparkling, or meadows greener than these? In a
secluded corner of the world, Loughrigg does nothing
but look pretty: there is no message to the mind
from its beauty save that of surpassing beauty in
repose.</p>
<p>Coniston is a splendid place to start from for another
journey. The nearest point is Gates Water, under
Dow crags. The way is not particularly difficult,
but the scenery is impressive. The great crag rising
sheer almost from the water&rsquo;s edge is a haunt of the
raven, a bird yearly growing scarcer as the wildernesses
become less wild, and as the shepherd gets more
reliable fire-arms. But, says legend, there is one raven
quite impossible to reach. It has dwelt on Kurnal Crag
since the dawn of Britain&rsquo;s history. Yet it failed its
post. It was the Druid&rsquo;s familiar, and when invasion
rolled nor&rsquo;ward it became a sentry over the settlement
of Torver. &ldquo;False bird,&rdquo; cried the old Druid, when
from the mystic holly circle he saw the Britons&rsquo; camp
burning and the Roman legion pursuing the defeated
remnant of his people, &ldquo;and this is how thy promise
of sleepless day and night is fulfilled. Thou wast to
croak when danger threatened, and instead I wake
to see thee join the invader&rsquo;s rank.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay, father
Druid, I went to fight the yellow bird they carry in
their van. It is but a bit of burnished bronze they
hold up, and no bird, and I stayed too long surveying
it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Venerable bird, venerable as myself and as old,
I had it in my mind to condemn thee to die, but
instead thou shalt live, live, live on the topmost crag
of Dow, till another army sweep away the Roman,
and the yellow bird is carried southward over
sands.&rdquo; The time came when the Roman legions
hurried south, and the raven, well stricken in years,
hoped for release; but it did not come, for the last
legion, on a misty morning, became involved in a
swamp on Torver moor, and standard-bearer and
burnished bird were swallowed in deep mud. There
they lie and moulder, and the old story is that unless
they are found and the eagle carried south the raven
of Kurnal Crag may not die. You can hear its aged,
rumbling croak afar off, at times when thunder is in
the air, and you linger in the gulf of Gates Water
to hear the first echoing bellow of the storm.</p>

<p>From Gates Water the wanderer goes over the Old
Man to Low Water, really one of the most elevated
mountain waters. It is splendidly situated, screes
and boulders from forbidding cliffs falling right to its
shores. It is pleasant to be here at sunset and watch
the gloom collect on the summits around. The tarn
is credited with almost diabolically large trout, but no
one catches them now, and anglers are sceptic. The
hillside you traverse to reach Levers Water is almost
honeycombed with the shafts of old copper mines.
&ldquo;Mines Valley&rdquo; indeed was once the busiest haunt of
men in the Lake Country. Its copper is now being
exploited afresh, and the prosperity of sixty years
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
ago may be repeated. Some of us would rather hear
the skirl of the curlew than the roar of ore-mills, but
if dividends are possible the lover of the untamed
land will once again have to move on. There is
no guarantee, save at Thirlmere, that an unspeakable
hideousness of industry will not suddenly blot out our
remotest haunt. From Levers Water the rambler
climbs the ridge toward Seathwaite tarn, now a reservoir
for the use of warrior Barrow. This tarn the lord
of the manor had the exclusive right to net, and the
annual occasion was always made a picnic. Nets were
shot, and the finny spoil, char, trout and perch, drawn
ashore. Then, as quickly as possible, a tithe of them
was prepared and cooked at fires on the shingly strand.
The merry-making was a splendid break in the silence
of the year here. The tarn also has a small gullery,
though miles from the nearest arm of the sea.</p>
<p>The charms of Tarn Hows I have mentioned in
my chapter on Coniston Water; it is well worthy an
afternoon&rsquo;s ramble, though if the visitor can put off
the hour till the last charabanc has rattled down the
glen, he will be the more repaid.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>My space limit has long run out, so I must only
indicate the positions of a last knot of tarns. Devoke
Water, within a few miles of Eskdale Green, holds
pink-fleshed trout, the progenitors of which are said to
have been brought by the monks of Furness Abbey
from sunny Italy. Burnmoor tarn lies between lofty
Scawfell and Wastwater Screes. The moor around is
studded with Druid circles and other memorials of
a vanished race. Then in Stye Head pass is a dark
brooding tarn; on the fell towards Great End is
Sprinkling tarn, near which is the famous rain gauge,
where annually the highest English rainfall is recorded.
In twenty minutes an inch of rain once fell here; I have
had several quick-time drenchings in this neighbourhood.
On the fells between Wastwater and Ennerdale
are Scoat and Lowfell tarns, the former of which is
reputed to contain a golden fish, and the latter a
silvery one. Floutern tarn is the furthest away of
the mountain waters, lying on the desolate fell between
Buttermere and Ennerdale.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
